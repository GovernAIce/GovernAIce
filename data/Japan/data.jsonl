On the one hand, it is hard to argue that Japan possesses adequate competitiveness with regard to AI technology.\n\nOn the other hand, Japan, along with pursuing Society 5.0 1 and contributing to the solution of global issues  (SDGs 2 ),  aims  to  create  a  \"Circulating  and  Ecological  Economy 3 ,\"  as  a  model  for  practical implementation in the field of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).    And Japan must take action in advance of other countries to resolve many social issues faced by a mature society such as an aging population, shrinking population and deterioration of infrastructure.    These issues are not problems that can be solved with technologies such as AI, but it is necessary to coordinate technology and social mechanisms  in  a  transformational  way  in  order  to  realize  a  \"sustainable  society  that  incorporates diversity\".\n\nAt  the March  2017  Artificial Intelligence  Technology  Strategy  Council  meeting,  Japanese government drew up the Artificial Intelligence Technology Strategy and its Industrialization Roadmap, which  designates \"productivity,\" \"health, medical  care, and  long-term  care,\" \"mobility,\"  and \"information security\" as core areas of focus, where the public and private sectors will collaborate on\n\n1 The 5 th Science and Technology Basic Plan states \"We will provide the necessary things and services to people who need them, and when necessary, respond precisely to the various needs of society, providing high quality services for all people, creating a society where all people can receive high-quality services and can live actively and comfortably, overcoming various differences in age, gender, region, and language.\"    The Comprehensive Strategy on Science, Technology and Innovation 2017 states \"Cyber and Physical Spaces should be highly integrated to provide products and services that meet the diverse needs and potential needs without disparities due to things such as region, age, gender, or language.    This is a human-centric society that can balance economic development and social issues, and allow people to live comfortable, vibrant, high-quality lives.\"\n\n2 Sustainable Development Goals: The international goals from 2016 to 2030 described in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted at the UN Summit in September of 2015, consisting of 17 goals and 169 targets to realize a sustainable world, and pledge to leave no one on earth behind.\n\n3 In the 5 th Basic Environment Plan (April 17, 2018 Cabinet Decision) \"This Plan aims to create a \"Circulating and Ecological Economy' that produces new value chains, complements and supports regional resources by building broader networks, which is composed of natural connections (connections among forests, the countryside, rivers and the sea) and, economic connections (composed of human resources, funds, and others), while making full use of mountainous, agricultural and fishing villages, and cities.    Each region will demonstrate its strengths by utilizing its unique characteristics, thereby building a self-reliant and decentralized society where different resources are circulated within each region, and symbiosis and exchange with neighboring regions according to unique characteristics of each region.\"\n\nAI technology spanning the full pipeline from R&amp;D to social implementation.    In August of 2018, an action plan oriented towards further embodying and strengthening the government's efforts based on this Strategy was put together; the action plan specifies the objectives and timetable for accomplishment for each initiative.    However, with regard to the deployment of AI technology in domains such as big data,  there  has  been  an  increasingly  fierce  battle  for  supremacy  over  the  last  few  years  among companies  based  in  certain  countries,  notably  the  US  and  China,  along  with  various  disruptive innovations in various fields that defy conventional projections of advances, all of which has left Japan in a position of having falling behind.    Conversely, some hold the view that because the extent of potential fields for introducing AI technology is so wide, competition in areas such as data collection and utilization in the field has just begun, and the decisive contest is yet to come.\n\nGiven this, in order to take the next step forward in overcoming issues facing Japan, making use of Japan's  strengths  to  open  up  opportunities  for  the  future,  we  will  focus  on  measures  that  Japanese government should immediately take concerted action on, which are summarized in this Strategy.\n\n## I. Basic Concept\n\n## (A) Scope of the Strategy\n\nThe term \"Artificial Intelligence (hereinafter AI)\" in this Strategy presumes a system that realizes an intelligent function 4 .\n\n4 AI (artificial intelligence), for example, in the EC High-Level Expert Group report, it is considered as \"a system that performs intelligent operations (sometimes with certain autonomy) in response to environment and input\", however, the substance of \"intelligent action\" also has an aspect that depends on interpretation.    Also, the AI-100 report published in the US in 2016, cites the definition of Nils J. Nilsson that AI as a field of study is \"research that makes intelligent machines, and intelligence works properly with some kind of insight in the environment where it is placed\", but this definition has great ambiguity.    In fact, in the same report, the vague definition of AI itself has a positive aspect that is accelerating AI research.    In light of these circumstances, although there is a certain consensus regarding whether to judge something as \"AI\" or \"AI technology\", it is not meaningful to define it more strictly on the basis of the technology, etc. used there.    At the same time, it should be noted that such a system is incorporated into a highly complex system.    Furthermore, implementation of the AI system cannot be realized without the necessary infrastructure for large-scale data collection and storage, infrastructure access, ultra-high-speed communication networks, sensors, robots, and the like.    Without the development and implementation of technology that ensures the safety and soundness of such systems, such as cyber security and AI ethics, it will be difficult for AI to be widely accepted.    AI encompasses a wide range of systems that realize functions considered to be intelligent and is expected to extend into all domains, ranging from the society and industry of the future to daily life, scientific research and technology development. Accordingly, this strategy must address planning for all these domains in an integrated manner.\n\nAlthough AI in recent years is mainly based on machine learning, especially deep learning, AI related technology is rapidly developing, and the definition of AI is not limited solely to technology used for AI.\n\n## (B) Purpose of the Strategy\n\nThe purpose of this Strategy is to specify the environment and measures conducive to effective future utilization of AI for the purposes of contributing to the solution of global issues through realization of Society 5.0 and overcoming the issues facing Japanese society.\n\nThis Strategy establishes an integrated policy package for AI that encompasses educational reform, research  and  development  (R&amp;D)  and  social  implementation  in  order  to  contribute  to  the  world, overcome challenges, and ultimately improve Japan's industrial competitiveness.\n\n## (C) Principles behind the Strategy\n\nIn March of 2019, the government compiled the \"Social Principles of Human-Centric AI.\"\n\nThis document specifies the form of society that Japan should aim for, a multilateral framework, and a policy direction that the national and local governments should aim for as AI develops. It defines three points as its basic principles:\n\n- (i) Dignity - A society in which human dignity is respected\n- (ii) Diversity and Inclusion - A society in which people with diverse backgrounds can pursue their own well-being.\n- (iii) Sustainability - A sustainable society.\n\nThis Strategy respects these basic principles.\n\n## (D) Basic Concept for Strategy Promotion\n\nIn order to realize the basic principles of section (C) above, that is, to have a \"sustainable society that incorporates  diversity\",  it  is  important  to  introduce  new  technologies  including AI  in  parallel  with reforming social systems.    Furthermore, it is essential that the introduction of AI yield benefits that are tangible to individual citizens and that new technologies and social systems are widely accepted.\n\nIn addition, while moving forward with the implementation of Society 5.0, Japan must improve its international presence and radically strengthen its industrial competitiveness.    In doing so, as laid out in the \"Social Principles of Human-Centric AI,\" it is important for diverse human resources, regardless\n\nof their diverse backgrounds in terms of gender, age, political beliefs, and religion to be able to contribute based on a wide range of knowledge, perspectives, ideas, and so on.\n\nThe government, as the overall coordinator, bearing in mind the above-mentioned points, needs to steadily promote the various measures described in this Strategy while maintaining full awareness of the following points.\n\n- (i) The main players in industry are private sector companies, and for these companies to exercise their full capabilities, factors such as provision of foundations (training and recruiting of human resources, promotion of R&amp;D, maintenance of the industrial base and support for commercialization),  the  establishment  of  a  system  to  accelerate  the  introduction  of  new technologies  and  removal  of  impeding  factors,  and  the  establishment  of  a  multinational framework are essential.\n- (ii)  Implementation of the AI system requires, for example, large-scale data collection and storage, infrastructure for access, ultra-high-speed communication networks, sensor clusters, and robots.\n- (iii) In  order  to  achieve  the  social  acceptance  of AI,  it  is  important  to  develop  and  implement technology, including cyber security and AI ethics, that ensures system safety and integrity; to improve literacy related to AI; to have appropriate communication between developers/operators and users; and to foster recognition of the tangible benefits of AI.\n\n## (E) Strategic Objectives\n\nThe following strategic objectives are set for this Strategy.\n\n## Strategic Objective 1\n\nFor Japan to develop a base of human resources which, in proportion to population, leads the world in being aligned with the needs of the AI era, and to become a country that attracts human resources from around the world.    In addition, to build a mechanism to achieve this objective on a sustainable basis.\n\n\"Human resources aligned with the needs of the AI era\" are not a uniform type of person.    They may be divided into various categories, such as\n\n- \u30fb People who carry out advanced AI research;\n- \u30fb People who apply AI to industry;\n\n- \u30fb People who realize application in small and medium-sized businesses;\n- \u30fb People engaged in new business creation using AI;\n\nHowever categorized, each category needs to have a deep talent pool.\n\nIn  order  to  deepen  the  talent  pool,  it  is  important  to  have  strategies  to  develop  and  attract  people according to their needs, including diverse human resources including women and people from overseas who aspire to work in Japan.    Therefore, in the future, it will be important to establish a leading-edge education programs, and further, it will be necessary to enhance it to a level that can be offered overseas as well.\n\nIn daily life, more effective use of AI improves the convenience of life and enables people to do things that could not have been done without AI.    However, in order to do so, it is necessary to raise people's literacy  of AI  and  make  it  possible  for  each  individual  to  appreciate  and  utilize  the  benefits  of AI willingly and without anxiety.\n\n## Strategic Objective 2\n\n## For Japan to become a frontrunner in the application of AI to real-world industry and to achieve strengthened industrial competitiveness.\n\nThe \"real world industry\" 5 domain encompasses value-generating activities which cannot be fully executed within cyberspace, but only by interactions among people, nature, hardware, etc.    This domain contains a vast amount of information that has not yet been systematically acquired.\n\nIn this domain, because in many cases it is extremely important to promote the transition to high valueadded industries centered on service platforms, we aim to improve Japan's industrial competitiveness and secure and maintain a position as a frontrunner in the world by promoting AI related development support,  system  design,  and  laying  of  foundations  for  social  implementation  that  contributes  to  this transition.    This is an objective to be realized in conjunction with policies other than AI strategy, but there AI strategy unquestionably plays an important part.    Labor productivity can be considered as a\n\n5 A generic term for industries that provide some value in the physical real world, such as medicine, agriculture, materials, logistics, and manufacturing equipment.    In contrast to SNS and search services, it is characterized as not being completed within cyberspace, but creates value for the first time through interaction with people, nature, hardware, etc.\n\nmeasure of industrial  competitiveness.    As  a  reference,  in  order  to  reach  labor  productivity  levels 6 equivalent to those of other countries such as the US, Germany and France within the next 10 years or so, Japan must maintain a nominal labor productivity growth rate of over 6% for 10 years, making it clear that a very bold change in industrial structure is necessary. And concurrently, through this domain Japan can contribute to the achievement of SDGs on a global scale.\n\nIn addition, it is also important to aim at further improvement of service quality, improvement of the working environment, and ultimately the reduction of fiscal burdens by applying AI in the public service sector.\n\nNote that the type of service industries that are almost completely in cyberspace, such as e-commerce and SNS, are a subject for future study.\n\n## Strategic Objective 3\n\nFor a series of technology systems to be established in Japan that will realize a \" sustainable society that incorporates diversity \" , and to implement a mechanism to operate them.\n\nIt is extremely important for women, foreigners, elderly people and other diverse people with diverse backgrounds to be able to fully participate in society while enjoying diverse lifestyles.    We will promote the establishment of AI-related diverse technology systems along with the creation of social systems and mechanisms to use them with the aim of individual citizen being able to enjoy tangible benefits.\n\nIn  addition, this strategic objective is not intended to be limited in scope by Japan's borders; it is important to formulate a plan for implementation on the premise that promoting this objective on a global scale can significantly contribute to the achievement of SDGs.\n\n## Strategic Objective 4\n\nFor Japan to take a leadership role in building international research, education, and social infrastructure  networks  in  the AI  field,  and  to  accelerate AI-related  R&amp;D,  human  resource development, achievement of SDGs, etc.\n\n6 Nominal labor productivity (per hour) of major countries in 2017: US $72.0 USD, Germany $69.8, France $67.8, Japan $47.5 (all converted to purchasing power parity) (Source: Japan Productivity Foundation Headquarters \"International Comparison of Labor Productivity in 2018\").\n\nWith  economic  and  social  globalization  rapidly  advancing,  objectives  such  as AI  related  human resource development/provision and industrial development cannot be fully accomplished solely within Japan,  so  we  must  always  maintain  an  international  perspective.    For  example,  in  human  resource development and provision, it is necessary to provide many venues for overseas researches and engineers to be active in Japan, and to increase joint R&amp;D and joint projects between Japan and foreign countries. For this reason, in addition to strengthening collaboration with research and education institutions and companies in North America and Europe, we will fully engage in collaborations with regions having future growth prospects such as ASEAN, India, the Middle East, and Africa.    We will provide AI related education programs to these areas, and take the opportunity of TICAD7 (Yokohama) to contribute to the promotion of AI research and commercialization in those areas.    To achieve this, the core centers of the AI Research and Development Network, etc., in each priority area will need to clarify plans for which areas in which to conduct world-leading research and, with respect to emergent research, how to draw on an international talent pool in order to maintain the diversity of human resources and themes.\n\nAdditionally, in fields such as health, medical care, and long-term care, agriculture, and smart cities, we aim for international collaboration and cooperation at a scale that offers mutual advantages in terms of human resources, data and markets.\n\n## (F) Role Sharing Between Public and Private Sectors\n\nA unified effort between the public and private sectors is essential to realize this Strategy.\n\nAmong these, by carrying out the following activities, the government 1will maintain an environment for the creation of a new society for the future (Society 5.0) and assiduously support private sector efforts towards the renovation of Japan's industrial structure through activities such as improving productivity, creating diverse value, and launching clusters of start-up companies.\n\n- \uf0d8 Development of strategy and formulation of a roadmap to realize it\n- \uf0d8 Immediate removal of institutional and policy obstacles\n- \uf0d8 Establishing networks for problem solving among multiple stakeholders\n- \uf0d8 Development of human resources including domestic and foreign workers\n- \uf0d8 Social implementation of social structure transformation and measures for the survival of the nation\n- \uf0d8 Fundamental R&amp;D, next generation basic research\n- \uf0d8 Provision of a common environment for acceleration of AI utilization\n- \uf0d8 Ethics, formation of national and international governance systems\n- \uf0d8 Creation of a \"global network\" hub\n\nIt is necessary for the private sector, on the other hand, with full understanding of the purpose of this Strategy, to comply with the Social Principles of AI and to pursue international collaboration with other countries/regions  and  cooperation  with  diverse  stakeholders  while  introducing  an  internationally competitive compensation system for talented human resources.    Furthermore, for the sake of jointly creating the future, the private sector must actively contribute to future economic and social development with the awareness of their core role in undertaking a major challenge.\n\n## II. Building a Foundation for the Future: Education Reform and Reconstruction of the Research and Development System\n\n## II-1 Education Reform\n\nCurrently, our society is undergoing a major transition through digital transformation.    One of the major driving forces of this change is AI, and there is the increasing demand for human resources capable of creating and using AI, designing new ways of society (a \"sustainable society that incorporates diversity\"), designing products and services suitable for the new society and creating new value.    It is no exaggeration to say that this, coupled with the ability to collect, store and analyze big data, is one of the biggest factors determining the vitality of society and industry in the future. For this reason, the training and securing of related human resources is an urgent and a long-term issues including primary and secondary, higher, recurrent 7 and lifelong education.

Combined with the relative decline of the Japanese economy in the global economy, it has now become difficult for Japan to conduct a domestic-only agenda for various AI related technology R&amp;D.    Moreover, this is also contributing to a delay in deployment of AI in complex sectors such as manufacturing, medical practice and mobility.\n\nIn Japan, there is a history of basic research, general-purpose research, and applied research in each sector developing independently in a decentralized fashion.    While they have formed a group of AIrelated core centers 20 with excellent capabilities in certain basic research, and public research institutes that have an excellent track record of applied research in specific fields, it is undeniable that there have been few crossover activities between them.    From now on, in order to further improve Japan's AI related  research  capabilities  and  push  forward  with  social  implementation  of  research  results,  it  is important for all the research institutes to cooperate and complement each other while demonstrating their own strengths, making it necessary to establish a R&amp;D network centered on AI related core centers.\n\nAmong these, each AI-related core center is expected to continue to produce world-class results in each priority area and to become an international hub. So far, the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP) has been researching and developing innovative fundamental technologies centering on theoretical research and integrally advancing them to the social implementation stage; the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT)  is  engaged  in  R&amp;D  focusing  on  natural  language  processing,  multilingual  translation,\n\n20 Includes the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology AI Research Center (AIST AIRC), National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Universal Communication Research Institute (UCRI), and the Center for Information and Neural Networks (CiNet)\n\nmultilingual  speech  processing,  cognitive  model  building  of  the  brain,  and  provision  and  social implementation of a usage environment including stored data; and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial  Science  and  Technology  (AIST) AI  Research  Center  (AIRC)  has  mainly  pursued  social implementation  centered  on  bridging  (the  practical  application  side)  to  companies  with  superior AI technology.    Moving  forward,  RIKEN  AIP  aims  to  be  the  world  leader  in  R&amp;D  of  innovative fundamental  technologies  centering  on  AI  theoretical  research,  NICT  aims  for  the  realization  of interactive technology through innovative natural language processing using large-scale data, developing multilingual  translation  and  speech  processing  technology  including  handling  of  foreign visitors from Asia and foreigners residing in Japan, and being the world's top leader in construction and application of a cognitive model of the brain aiming at the realization of heart-to-heart communication, and AIST AIRC aims to lead the world as the core research organization bridging AI based technology and society to real-world applications of AI. Additionally, each AI-related core center aims to rapidly transfer research results to find uses in society.\n\nOn the other hand, on the front lines of R&amp;D, there is an urgency to deal with new issues such as ensuring the quality of AI, securing the reliability of the entire network, and responding to cyber-attacks. In order to respond to these issues, not only the linear extension of R&amp;D conducted up until now, but also  new  engineering  approaches  and  cross-disciplinary  approaches  are  indispensable,  as  is  quickly pivoting away from follow-up research that loses sight of Japan's strengths.\n\nFirst of all, in order to make use of Japan's strengths and to revitalize Japan's future, (i) development of AI for the real-world domain and (ii) AI designed for inclusion will be the two major pillars of R&amp;D. It is essential to construct a technological system aligned with these pillars, to push forward with basic research,  and  then  advance  to  application  and  implementation.    Additionally,  as  a  premise  of  these pillars, it is important for Japan to establish a stack of technologies and operational know-how to develop AI with a high and reliable level of quality (Trusted Quality AI).    This is important both in terms of reflecting the principles in the \"Social Principles of Human-Centric AI\" and in terms of establishing a competitive advantage.\n\nIn the application of AI to the real world domain, it is important to establish the theory, technology base, and  development  and  operation  process  that  will  make  the  development  of  an  effective AI  system possible under the constraints of data of very high dimensionality with inaccuracy and incompleteness,\n\nand in many cases, where a sufficient amount of data cannot be obtained.    In addition, since the AI system is a system integrated with sensors, IoT, robots, infrastructure, etc., it is important to have a technology base on which these systems can easily be built.    It is necessary to establish a R&amp;D system that views the process in terms of the full pipeline from research results to social implementation.\n\nAdditionally, the cluster of technologies that support the realization of diversity and social inclusion, called \"inclusion technology\", has among its aims to realize the principles of universal design within a large framework linked to the pursuit of R&amp;D oriented towards the development and implementation of inclusion technology and the realization of institutional reforms and digital government.    At the present time, inclusion technology is not a well-established concept, and due to the nature of meeting diverse needs of diverse people, is not a single technology but rather a collection of diverse technologies.    For this  reason,  it  is  necessary  to  identify  technology,  operation  and  organizational  universality  and  to establish  a  new  technology  system.    As  an  emergent  research  field,  inclusion  technology,  while focusing on a number of themes with obvious applications, must at the same time progress towards creating diverse solutions for diverse needs.\n\nFurthermore, when viewed from the perspective of medium and long-term innovation, it is critical to have emerging research oriented toward creating new value that cannot be predicted at the present stage, generating diverse seeds, and spurring cross-disciplinary integration at the basic research stage.\n\nConsequently, we emphasize the diversity of R&amp;D and set up the following four R&amp;D approaches (programs):\n\n- (i) Basic research on AI and development of foundational technologies (AI Core)\n- (ii) R&amp;D on applying AI to real-world industries\n- (iii) R&amp;D on achieving inclusion through AI\n- (iv) Emerging research to pioneer blue-sky fields and technologies arising from a diversity of ideas\n\nAmong these, approaches (i) to (iii) are strategic programs, that is, programs based on recognition and prediction of technology trends, issues in Japan, and future directions, and are premised on a certain course of action and scenarios.    In addition, (ii) and (iii) have aspects that require research based on diversity in problem identification and ideas, and a certain percentage will be implemented as a themeoriented emergent research program.\n\nThe emergent research in approach (iv) should be a program that imposes no constraints on research content,  based  on  the  fact  that  research  that  leads  to  many  disruptive  innovations  is  actually  being generated  from  non-focused  areas.    At  the  same  time,  it  is  necessary  to  design  programs  with  an emphasis on diversity, under the hypothesis that emergent research is created from the integration of diverse human resources and disciplines.    Also, in this context, it is necessary to establish a globally attractive system design and operation system.\n\nIn view of the difficulty of Japan going it alone in conducting various AI related technology R&amp;D, we will make up for the shortage of domestic human resources in the future by attracting and exchanging international human resources, therefore recruitment and management of programs must be conducted in English.\n\n## \uff1c Main Objectives \uff1e\n\n- \uf09e Building of a comprehensive R&amp;D cycle spanning basic research through social implementation in accord with

System Components of AI\n\n## (Initiatives)\n\n- \uf09e Based on the overall structure of AI R&amp;D below, referring to (Appended Table 1), creating a development pipeline chart in the field of AI related R&amp;D (FY 2019) and reviewing it annually [MIC, MEXT, METI]\n\nPhysical Scale\n\nFigure: Overall Structure of AI R&amp;D\n\n## III. Establishing a Foundation for Industry and Society\n\n## III - 1 Social Implementation\n\nAs already emphasized, by combining Japan's technology strengths with AI technology, we must aim to realize a \"sustainable society that incorporates diversity\" while contributing to the solution of global issues,  creating  substantial  added  value,  improving  productivity,  and  further  strengthening  industrial competitiveness.\n\nIn  particular,  the  real-world  industry  domain  is  an  area  where  Japanese  companies  have  a  large presence in the world at present.    Consequently, Japan should be able to demonstrate superiority and take leadership in the realization of application of AI technology to the real-world industry domain (AI for Real World) and inclusion (AI for Inclusion).\n\nHowever, in developing and deploying AI systems for the real-world industry domain, it is essential to  provide  domain-specific  expertise  and  know-how,  as  well  as  deal  with  case-by-case  factors, including operation.    For this reason, in the current situation where the source of value has shifted to the service platform, settling for business models that are simply an extension of linear trends up to the present could result in Japanese industry losing preeminence, as hardware and other devices become terminals of service platforms,\n\nAt this point, first of all, as a sector-wide effort, in order to promote structural transformation to high value-added service industries (as measured by GDP per Capita, etc.) centered on AI-driven services and to dramatically improve productivity, it is necessary to develop architecture-based technology and form social implementation infrastructure.\n\nFurthermore, the individual optimization of each domain is not enough; a system architecture must be designed  to  promote  social  implementation  across  fields.    Designing  such  an  architecture  requires highly specialized system engineering expertise and experience; unfortunately, there is a critical shortage of such experts in Japan.    For that reason, it is necessary to build a cross-ministerial promotion system, in reference to the efforts of organizations such as the United States' NIST 25 , and working in cooperation\n\n25 National Institute of Standards and Technology\n\nwith relevant organizations in other countries, deploy Japan's limited number of specialists to conduct carry out system architecture design more efficiently and promote standardization.\n\nThe five areas of health, medical care, and long-term care, agriculture, national resilience (to disasters), transportation infrastructure and logistics, and regional revitalization are designated as priority areas.\n\nThis is because Japan's top priority is finding solutions to social issues the country is facing, such as being the first country to face the full-blown effects of a declining birthrate and an aging population along with the resulting rapid increase in social security costs; decline in the workforce and shortage of healthcare  and  long-term  care  workers;  extreme  aging  population  of  the  agricultural  workforce;  the increase in disasters and damage to agriculture, forestry and fisheries due to climate change and extreme weather;  and  the  aging  and  deterioration  of  infrastructure  and  the  shortage  of  human  resources  to maintain infrastructure in regional Japan.\n\nIn the health, medical care, and long-term care fields, the medium and long term goal is to achieve better health for the public, improved levels of medical and long-term care, and an improved working environment for health-related workers while simultaneously reducing the burden on taxpayers.\n\nIn the area of regional revitalization (smart cities), this Strategy has foremost in mind regional cities (without excluding large cities).    First of all, it is important to improve the quality of life in regional cities and regions and to nurture the development of local industries, but at the same time, aim to reduce the burden on local government finances.\n\nIn  doing  so,  rather  than  prioritizing  the  logic  of  the  infrastructure  and  service  providers,  the perspectives of diverse residents and local businesses should be emphasized.    This approach is firmly rooted in the principle of \"a sustainable society that incorporates diversity\", and is expected to contribute to the realization of high value-added services in the region.\n\nIn addition, once social implementation of these five domains is realized in Japan, the high valueadded services they generate can be expanded overseas, with unquestionable potential to contribute to the solution of global SDGs.\n\n## \uff1c Main Objectives \uff1e\n\nTo bring together the wisdom of industry, academia and government, setting the following goals, with the building of a framework for sustainable social implementation in mind:\n\n- \uf09e Based on a data infrastructure grounded in architecture design, being at the forefront globally in achieving AI social implementation in five key areas: (i) health, medical care and longterm  care; (ii) agriculture; (iii) national resilience (to disasters); (iv) transportation infrastructure  and  logistics;  and  (v)  regional  revitalization  (smart  cities). In  addition, undertaking efforts to achieve social implementation in manufacturing, finance and other fields\n- \uf09e Promotion of participation of private sector actors in social implementation models for each domain  (including  studying  the  prospects  for  rolling  out  the  entire  system  in  overseas markets)\n- \uf09e In  health,  medical  care,  and  long-term  care  fields,  maintaining  an  environment  in  which people feel assured that they can receive the most advanced and effective treatments as wells as high quality long-term care regardless of location, reducing the burden on medical care and long-term care providers\n- \uf09e In the agricultural sector, almost all the business farmers utilizing data in their workflow by 2025\n- \uf09e In the domain of national resilience, introducing a nationwide system to ensure the safety of infrastructure while minimizing maintenance and repair costs, and managing and sharing all types of data related to Japan's territory for that purpose\n- \uf09e In  the  transportation  infrastructure  and  logistics  domain,  exploring how to build the data infrastructure for distribution and logistics; improving productivity and increase added value in logistics and efficiency improvement of the entire supply chain by linking with other data infrastructures,  automation,  etc.;  enabling  all  people  to  enjoy  freedom  of  movement  and safety while doing so, without exceeding current social costs\n- \uf09e In the regional revitalization (smart city) domain, coordination with other domains such as agriculture and health, medical care, and long-term care, adoption of inclusion technology and building a smart city model that can also be rolled out to overseas markets.\n\n## \uff1c Specific

It is extremely important to collect high quality data, keep it safe from risks such as cyber-attacks and use it for analysis.\n\nFor this reason, in order to keep pace with other countries, Japan also needs to work on coordination and standardization of data possessed by the government and the private sector.    And in the process, prevent bias in big data and avert potential risks of AI utilization.\n\nOn the other hand, it is extremely important to ensure the trustworthiness of data, authenticity, and identify  verification.    In  the  United  States  there  is  already  a  trust  infrastructure  in  the  government procurement sector, and a common trust infrastructure in the EU is under construction. Japan has begun studying the issue, but, for example, we need to accelerate the consideration of measures to ensure the security of the entire supply chain (\"Cyber Physical Security Framework\").\n\n## \uff1c Main Objective \uff1e\n\nBuilding a next-generation AI data related infrastructure premised on international collaboration\n\n## (1) Data Infrastructure\n\n## \uff1c Specific Objectives \uff1e\n\nFull-fledged operation of data linkage infrastructure for utilization of AI in five key areas (health, medical care, and long-term care;

In fact, in the US and China, AI related venture capital investments are expanding rapidly, and many unicorn companies  are  emerging.    Japan  needs  to  provide  an  environment  that  encourages  sharing  of  AI technology, effective utilization of AI in companies and government administration, and the creation of new products and services.\n\n## \uff1c Main Objectives \uff1e\n\n- \uf09e Provision  of  data  infrastructure  and  improvement  of  productivity  and  growth  potential through AI utilization in low-productivity and growth sectors\n- \uf09e Enhanced support for AI related business startups\n\n## (1) Support for Small and Medium Enterprises\n\n## \uff1c Specific Objective \uff1e\n\nImproving productivity of SMEs through utilization of AI\n\n## (Initiatives)\n\n- \uf09e Identification of the needs and issues of SMEs for problem-solving type AI human resource development projects (FY 2019) [METI]\n- \uf09e Launch and progression of new service models through solution of management issues by problem-solving type AI human resource development projects, regional universities, etc. (FY 2020) [MEXT, METI]\n\n## (2) Support for Young AI Related Entrepreneurs\n\n## \uff1c Specific Objective \uff1e\n\nSupport for AI related start-up companies\n\n## (Initiatives)\n\n- \uf09e Implement measures based on the startup strategy  \"Beyond  Limits.

Ethics\n\nWhile interest in utilization of AI is increasing, an excessive pursuit of making life in our civilization ever more convenient could amplify the negative ramifications of AI.    In order to minimize this, a high ethical perspective that reflects the cultural background is important, and so-called AI social principles are needed in order to promote the use of AI in a way that respects human beings.    In light of these concerns, Japan formulated its Social Principles of AI and announced them in March of 2019; the EU did so in April of the same year.    Subsequently in May of 2019, the OECD Ministerial Council adopted a recommendation on AI and then in June, at the G20 Trade and Digital Economy Ministers' Meeting, agreement was reached on principles for AI around the concept of \"human-centric\".\n\nCurrently, in addition to Japan and the EU, countries such as Canada and Singapore are pursuing similar efforts, and discussions on ethics are also underway within international frameworks such as UNESCO and the G7. We can expect various debates around these issues, including about what new forms society should take, to become more and more active.\n\nAt  the  \"International  Conference  of  Data  Protection  and  Privacy  Commissioners\",  which  brings together experts in the field, discussions about the development of guidelines which adhere to principles of AI ethics and data protection have begun.\n\n## \uff1c Objective \uff1e\n\nDissemination of the Social Principles of AI and establishment of an international collaboration system\n\n## (Initiatives)\n\n- \uf09e Establishment of seven AI social principles on social framework in the AI-Ready society of \" Social Principles of Human-centric AI\" (FY 2020) [CSTI, MIC, MEXT, MHLW, METI]\n- \uf09e Establishment of a multilateral framework on the social principles of AI, including consideration for the prevention of ethics dumping 32   (FY 2021) [CSTI, PPC, MIC, MOFA, MEXT, MHLW, METI]\n\n32 Ethics dumping: Conducting unethical research in countries/regions where ethics rules are loose.\n\n## V.    Miscellaneous\n\nAs previously mentioned, the social and technological contexts surrounding AI have been rapidly changing and developing in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States, China, Europe, Canada, and various Asian countries, have formulated national AI strategies, and in Europe and Asia there has been a surge in international cooperation and international joint R&amp;D among AI research centers in order to carry out these strategies.\n\nJapan must seize the opportunity that such a social environment presents to actively strive to secure international leadership in AI related fields.\n\nIn addition, in light of the fact that Japan is the G20 chair country and TICAD7 will be held in Japan this year, it is important to keep in mind that cooperation with developing countries, where interest in AI is expanding -- especially in Africa -- should be included in the scope.\n\n## \uff1c Main Objective \uff1e\n\nSecuring Japan's leadership role in the international community on AI related technologies\n\n## \uff1c Specific Objective 1 \uff1e\n\nRegular follow-up and review of this Strategy\n\n## (Initiatives)\n\n- \uf09e Building an AI strategy / AI social principles follow-up system in which diverse stakeholders collaborate  (AI  strategy  expert  meeting  for  strength  and  promotion  of  the  innovation), conducting follow-ups, and reviewing this Strategy as needed (FY 2019) [CSTI]\n- \uf09e Examination towards realization of Intellectual  Property systems, etc. to take advantage of Japan's strengths in accordance with the initiatives of this Strategy (FY 2019) [IP, METI]\n\n## \uff1c Specific Objective 2 \uff1e\n\nRaising Japan's global profile in organization, development, implementation, etc.\n\n## (Initiatives)\n\n- \uf09e G20 agreement on collaboration  for AI  ethical  principles  (FY  2019)  [CSTI,  MIC,  MOFA, METI]\n\n- \uf09e Contribution to TICAD7 (Yokohama) regarding AI human resource development, support for social implementation, etc. (FY 2019) [CSTI, MIC, MOFA, METI]\n- \uf09e Packaging AI related data, apps, etc. for international development (FY 2020) [MIC, MHLW, MAFF, METI, MLIT]\n- \uf09e 100 (approx.) top AI researchers/year invitation from around the world to Japan (FY 2020) [MIC, MEXT, METI]\n- \uf09e Attracting and supporting AI related international conferences such as the IJCAI 33 (FY 2020) [CSTI, MIC, MEXT, METI, MLIT]\n\n33 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence: to be held in Yokohama in 2020.\n\n## \uff08 Appended Table 1 \uff09 Core Foundation Research and Development\n\n| Future R&DPriority Items                           | Individual Items                                                                          | Concrete Initiative Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Achievement Period   | Agency   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------|\n| 1.

Japan is the first country to tackle many social issues confronting a mature society, such as the declining birthrate and aging population, labor shortage, rural depopulation, and increased fiscal spending. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is considered a key technology to rescue society from  these  problems,  to  address  the  goals  set  forth  in  the  United  Nation's  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to build a sustainable world.\n\nJapan, with the establishment of Society5.0 1 , whose purpose is to address social issues and economic  development  using  AI,  aims  to  revitalize  its  society  and  economy,  to  be  an internationally attractive society, and to contribute to the SDGs on a global scale.\n\nSimilar to many other types of science and technology, AI will bring many great benefits to society, but its large impact on society calls for appropriate development  and implementation. In order to avoid or reduce the negative aspects in advance while making effective use of AI to benefit society, we should promote, together with the continued research and development (R&amp;D) of technologies related to AI, a transformation into an \"AI-Ready Society\" where AI can be used effectively and safely. We need to redesign society in every way  including  Japan's  human  potential,  social  systems,  industrial  structures,  innovation systems, and governance.\n\nDepending on the researcher, there are various ways of thinking about the definition of AI (Artificial Intelligence), a central theme of this document, and there is no clear definition at present. For example, the EC High-Level Expert Group report 2 defines AI as a system that performs intelligent operations (which may have some autonomy) in response to environment and input. However, the expression \"intelligent operation\" itself is somewhat vague and open for interpretation. Also, the AI100 Report 3 published in the United States in 2016 cites Nils J. Nilsson's definition 4 of AI as a field of research according to which \"Artificial intelligence is that  activity  devoted  to  making  machines  intelligent,  and  intelligence  is  that  quality  that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment\", but this definition is also highly ambiguous. In actuality, the vague definition of AI within the same report in and of itself has a positive side that is accelerating the study of AI. In light of these circumstances, although there is a certain consensus on what to judge as AI or AI technology, it does not appear appropriate at this time to define it more strictly.\n\nIn addition, various technologies normally called \"AI\" are seldom used alone but instead are generally incorporated and used as part of an information system. Advanced and complex\n\n1 Society 5.0 is the future society that Japan aims for, following the Information Society (Society 4.0). A society that realizes Society 5.0 is a sustainable human-centric society that implements AI, IoT (Internet of Things), robotics and other cutting-edge technologies to create unprecedented value, and a wide range of people can realize their own well-being while respecting the well-being of others.\n\n2  High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG), \"Draft Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI\", and \"A definition of AI: Main capabilities and scientific disciplines\", European Commission, Directorate-General for Communication, December 2018.\n\n3 Stone, P., et al., \"Artificial Intelligence and Life 2030.

Nilsson, The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010.\n\ninformation systems may incorporate a broad range of AI technologies; moreover, they may incorporate technologies reflected in the principles stated in this document.  Based on these two premises, the  principles  herein  may  be  regarded  as  applying  to  any  \"highly  complex information systems in general\" that include any such technology. Given such consideration, we do not define a particular technology or system as \"AI\", but regard AI as \"highly complex information systems in general\". After discussing some of the impacts on society, we will present a set of AI social principles and identify some issues to consider in AI R&amp;D and social implementation.  In  order  to  make  the  ensuing  Society  5.0  as  effective  as  possible,  it  is essential for all relevant stakeholders to cooperate and interact closely with each other.\n\n5\n\nFigure 1 shows the overall structure of this document.\n\n## Section 2 Basic Philosophy\n\nDignity: A society that has respect for human dignity\n\nDiversity &amp; Inclusion: A society where people with diverse backgrounds can pursue their well-being\n\nSustainability: A sustainable society\n\nSection 3 Social Changes Needed to Realize Society 5.0 - \"AI-Ready Society 5 \"\n\nHuman Potential, Social Systems, Industrial Structures,\n\nInnovation Systems (environments that support innovation),\n\nGovernance\n\nSection 4 Social Principles of Human-Centric AI\n\n- 4.1 Social Principles of AI\n- (1) Human-Centric, (2) Education/Literacy, (3) Privacy Protection,\n- (4) Ensuring Security, (5) Fair Competition,\n- (6) Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, (7) Innovation\n- 4.2 R&amp;D and Utilization Principles of AI\n\nFigure 1:  Overall Structure of This Document\n\nAn \"AI-Ready Society\" means that society as a whole has undergone the necessary changes to maximize the benefits of AI, enjoys the benefits of AI, or has introduced AI immediately when needed and is in a state of being able to receive the benefits. It means \"a society adapted to the use of AI\". For this purpose, society as a whole needs to be transformed, including individuals, business organizations, and the social innovation environment. Individually, for example, everyone should acquire appropriate AI literacy that allows them to use AI for work and life. In business organizations, meanwhile, corporate activities should be developed with strategies premised on the use of AI. In the social innovation environment, all information should be digitized in a form that allows for AI analysis, should be transformed into data, and should be maintained in a state in which it can be used for AI development and service provision.\n\n## 2 Basic Philosophy\n\nAI is expected to contribute significantly to the realization of Society 5.0. We consider AI important not only to return the benefits obtained from the efficiency and convenience of using AI to people and society, but also to use AI for the public good of humanity as a whole, and to ensure global sustainability outlined in the SDGs through qualitative changes in social conditions and true innovation.\n\nWe believe we should respect the following three values as our philosophy and build a society that pursues their realization.\n\n## (1) Dignity: A society that has respect for human dignity\n\nWe should not build a society where humans are overly dependent on AI or where AI is  used  to  control  human  behavior  through  the  excessive  pursuit  of  efficiency  and convenience. We need to construct a society where human dignity is respected and, by using AI as a tool, a society where people can better demonstrate their various human abilities, show greater creativity, engage in challenging work, and live richer lives both physically and mentally.\n\n- (2) Diversity &amp; Inclusion: A society where people with diverse backgrounds can pursue their own well-being\n\nIt  is  both an ideal in the modern world and a major challenge to create a society in which people with diverse backgrounds, values and ways of thinking can pursue their own well-being while society creates new value by flexibly embracing them. AI is a technology powerful enough to bring us closer to this ideal. We need to change the nature of society in this way through the appropriate development and deployment of AI.\n\n## (3) Sustainability: A sustainable society\n\nWe need to use AI to create a succession of new businesses and solutions, resolve social disparities,  and  develop  a  sustainable  society  that  can  deal  with  issues  such  as  global environmental problems and climate change. Japan, as a leading science and technologyoriented country, has an obligation to strengthen its accumulated  scientific  and technological resources by utilizing AI and thereby contributing to the creation of such a sustainable society.\n\n## 3 Social Changes Needed to Realize Society 5.0  \"AI-Ready Society\"\n\nTechnologies  expected  to  contribute  to  the  realization  of  Society  5.0  include  AI,  IoT, Robotics,  and  ultra-high-speed  broadband  communication  networks.  Even  if  it  becomes possible to some extent to entrust complex processes to machines using AI, it is still necessary for humans to set objectives that answer the question \"What are we using AI for?\"  While AI can be used to better society, it might also be used for undesirable purposes or in inappropriate ways unconsciously. For this reason, we are advancing technological developments in terms of  Human  Potential,  Social  Systems, Industrial Structures, Innovation  Systems,  and Governance which can answer the question \"What are we using AI for?\" while paying close attention to their interaction with the progress of technology.  These five aspects are equally important in achieving Society 5.0.\n\n## (1) Human Potential\n\nIn an \"AI-Ready Society\" that is responsive to the spread of AI to every corner of society, how human beings respond to AI is the key to realizing a society where AI can be fully utilized. To that end, the expected abilities and roles of people are as follows.\n\n- A) People should fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of AI. In particular, people should have the ability to recognize that biases are included in the algorithms and/or data that will become the information resources of AI, and for example, that these biases may be used for undesirable purposes.  In addition, people should recognize that there are three types of data bias: statistical bias, bias caused by social conditions, and bias arising from malicious intent among AI users.\n- B) It is preferred that the use of AI will create an environment in which many people can engage in highly creative and productive work. To that end, it is expected that a diverse range of people will acquire the ability to realize their own dreams and ideas with AI's support despite many differences in origin, culture, taste, and so on. An education system that achieves these goals as well as social systems that contribute to their achievement must be realized.\n- C) It  is  important  to  have  sufficient  human  resources  with  acquired  application  skills  such  as implementation and design of AI systems and a basic knowledge of data and AI. These skills would  be  acquired  in  a  cross-disciplinary  range  of  fields  in  a  combined  and  integrated framework. It is expected that such human resources will be the driving force of all activities in society, and that the capabilities of those people will contribute to the formation of an AI-based living environment. Given the establishment of such a living environment, we must implement social systems that allow many people to live a richer and more fulfilling life.\n\n## (2) Social Systems\n\nThe use of AI will most likely accelerate the evolution of individual service solutions and create various benefits from improved efficiency and individualization. In order to embrace the full benefits of  this  change  in  society,  it  is  necessary  for  entire  social  systems  including  health  care,  finance, insurance, transportation, energy, and others to flexibly change and respond to the evolution of AI. This includes simple efficiency in light of existing socially accepted objectives (such as improved convenience and liberation from simple labor tasks). It  also  includes  the  realization  of  new  value potentially created by diversification and fluidization of objectives and resolving negative outcomes (such as inequality, widening disparity, social exclusion, and so on) that may result from the evolution of AI.\n\nTo this end, we need to implement flexible architecture designs equipped with mechanisms for expandability, interoperability, developing improved social order, and so on, both in the software and the  hardware  aspects  of  each  social  system.  Additionally,  we  need  to  establish  a  common  data\n\nutilization  infrastructure  for  various  social  systems,  in  particular  to  ensure  interoperability  and connectivity.\n\n## (3) Industrial Structures\n\nIn order for a diverse group of people to realize their assorted dreams and ideas, it is necessary for labor as well as employment and entrepreneur environments to be flexible and internationally open. For  this  reason,  companies  should  compete  fairly  and  promote  flexible  working  styles,  human creativity  should  continually  be  demonstrated  throughout  industries,  and  investment  in  startup businesses should be promoted.\n\n## (4) Innovation Systems (environments that support innovation)\n\nIt is necessary for universities, research institutions, industries, and the public at large to  participate  in  AI's  R&amp;D,  utilization  and  evaluation  across  fields  and  positions, stimulating each other, and creating an environment in which innovation can flourish.\n\nTo that end, all types of data including real space data should be instantaneously and securely available at a level that AI can analyze. Additionally, it is advisable to ensure privacy and security so that everyone can provide and distribute data with ease, and for there to be an environment where they can benefit from the data that they have provided.\n\nIt  is  advisable  to  accelerate  the  desired  development  of  AI  by  establishing  an environment in which those involved in R&amp;D, including users, can safely conduct R&amp;D and utilization of AI, and the cycle of R&amp;D and utilization can move rapidly. Preferably, the utilization of AI will create new ideas and possibilities, and significantly expand the potential of innovation.\n\n## (5) Governance\n\nIt is always necessary to continue to update the content and defined purposes discussed in the above-mentioned sections Human Potential, Social Systems, Industrial Structures, and Innovation Systems in line with social changes and technological developments.\n\nFor that reason, it is necessary to have a system that can be implemented and in place for various stakeholders, including government, industry, universities, research institutions,  and  the  general  public.  Then  they  will  be  able  to  work  together  on  such matters as identifying issues, evaluating impacts, and making decisions on regulatory governance including rules, systems, standardization and codes of conduct. Additionally, it is necessary to listen to people, including those who have a difficult time having their opinions  heard,  in  addition  the  various  stakeholders,  and  to  establish  a  system  that continuously addresses the most advanced social and technical issues.  When implementing such governance, flexible and effective measures should be taken not only in terms of the law but also by means of industries with appropriate technical means taking the initiative. In addition, international coordination for governance is important, and  in  addition  to  governance  in  each  individual  country,  an  international  system  of cooperation for dealing with cross-border problems should be established.\n\n## 4 Social Principles of Human-Centric AI\n\nWe recognize that in order to realize an \"AI-Ready Society\" and to promote an appropriate and proactive social implementation of AI, it is important to establish basic principles that each stakeholder should keep in mind.\n\nIn order for AI to be accepted and properly used by society, we will systemize these basic principles  into  \"Social  Principles  of  AI\"  to  which  society  (especially  state  legislative  and administrative bodies) should pay attention, and \"R&amp;D and Utilization Principles of AI\" to which developers and operators engaged in AI R&amp;D and social implementation should pay attention. The \"Social Principles of AI\" necessary for realizing a society with the three basic principles listed in Section 2, and the \"R&amp;D and Utilization Principles of AI\" that developers and business operators should consider, are as follows:\n\n## 4.1 Social Principles of AI\n\nSocial  Principles  of  AI  are  principles  relating  to  social  frameworks  that  should  be implemented across Japanese society including national and local governments as well as in multilateral frameworks in an \"AI-Ready Society.\"\n\n## (1) The Human-Centric Principle\n\nThe utilization of AI must not infringe upon the fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution and international standards.\n\nAI should be developed, utilized, and implemented in society to expand the abilities of people and allow diverse people to pursue their own well-being. In a society making use of AI, it is desirable that we introduce appropriate mechanisms for literacy education and for the promotion of proper use of AI so that people do not become over-dependent on AI or misuse AI to manipulate other people's decision-making.\n\n- \uf0d8 AI can expand human abilities and creativity not only by replacing aspects of human labor but also by assisting humans as a technologically advanced tool.\n- \uf0d8 When using AI, people must judge and decide for themselves how to use it. The appropriate stakeholders involved in the development, delivery and utilization of AI should be responsible for the consequences of AI utilization, depending on the nature of the problem.\n- \uf0d8 In the process of AI deployment, each stakeholder should take into consideration the user-friendliness of the system in order to allow all people to enjoy the benefits of  AI  and  avoid  creating  a  digital  divide  with  so-called  \"information  poor\"  or \"technology poor\" people left behind.\n\n## (2) The Principle of Education/Literacy\n\nIn a society premised on AI, we do not desire to create disparities or divisions between people or create those who are socially disadvantaged. Therefore, policy makers and managers  of  businesses  involved  in  AI  must  have  an  accurate  understanding  of  AI, knowledge and ethics permitting appropriate use of AI in society. They should take into account the complexity of AI and appreciate the possibility that AI could be intentional\n\nmisused.  AI  users  should  have  a  general  understanding  of  AI  and  should  acquire sufficient  education  to  use  it  properly,  given  that  AI  platforms  are  much  more complicated than already developed conventional tools. Regarding developers of AI, meanwhile, it is of course necessary for them to master the basics of AI technology. Additionally,  from  the  viewpoint  of  developing  AI  that  is  useful  to  society,  it  is important for developers to learn business models for how AI can be used in society, as well as to master a wide range of liberal arts such as social sciences and ethics including normative consciousness.\n\nFrom  this  point  of  view,  we  believe  that  an  educational  environment  that  fosters education and literacy in accordance with the following principles must be provided equally to all people.\n\n- \uf0d8 In  order  to  prevent  generating  disparities  between  people  or  to  create  socially vulnerable individuals, opportunities for education in a wide range of literacy skills are  to  be  provided  in  early  childhood  education  and  primary  and  secondary education. Opportunities are also to be provided for the reeducation of  working adults and the elderly.\n- \uf0d8 With regard to literacy education and skills required to use AI, our society needs an educational system that allows anyone to acquire the basics of AI, mathematics, and data  science.  All  people  need  to  learn  beyond  the  boundaries  of  literature  and science. It is also necessary to prepare content in literacy education on the limits of security and AI technology in order to raise awareness of AI and data characteristics. These characteristics include bias in data, the possibility of causing bias depending on how AI is used, and issues of fairness, impartiality, and privacy protection that are inherently needed in the use of AI.\n- \uf0d8 In  a  society  where  AI  is  pervasive,  it  is  to  be  expected  that  the  educational environment will change from the current unilateral and uniform teaching style to one that makes use of individual interests and skill sets. For that reason, society as a whole shares a sense that the education system is always changing flexibly to the optimal  form  of  teaching  regardless  of  previous  successful  experiences  in  the educational environment to date.  In education, it is desirable to have an interactive educational environment for the prevention of dropouts and an environment that fully utilizes AI technologies to allow students to work together.\n- \uf0d8 It is desirable not to impose an unnecessary burden only on the administration or schools (teachers), but to work independently with private enterprises and citizens toward the development of such an educational environment.\n\n## (3) The Principle of Privacy Protection\n\nNot all AI technologies increase the risk associated with the use of personal data, but in a society premised on AI, it is still possible to gauge each person's political position, economic  situation,  personal  hobbies,  personal  preferences,  and  so  forth  with  great accuracy based on data about matters such as data subject's individual behavior. This means, when utilizing AI, that more careful discretion may be required than the mere handling of personal data in accordance with the level of importance and sensitivity of the data. Each stakeholder must handle personal data based on the following principles to ensure that no individuals are disadvantaged from the unexpected distribution or use\n\nof personal data in undesirable ways.\n\n- \uf0d8 We should make sure that any AI using personal data and any service solutions that use AI, including use by the government, do not infringe on a person's individual freedom, dignity or equality.\n- \uf0d8 If the use of AI threatens to increase the possibility of harming individuals, technical mechanisms and non-technical frameworks should be developed to reduce the risk. In particular, AI using personal data should have mechanisms to ensure accuracy and legitimacy, and to allow individuals to be substantially involved in managing the privacy of their personal data. This would make it possible for people to provide personal data with peace of mind when using AI, and effectively benefit from the data they provide.\n- \uf0d8 Personal data must be protected appropriately according to its degree of importance and  sensitivity.  Personal  data  contains  a  variety  of  information,  ranging  from matters that are highly likely to have a great influence on an individual's rights and interests  (these  would  typically  be  personal  thoughts,  beliefs,  medical  history, criminal records, and so on), to matters that are semi-public in nature in a person's social  life.  Keeping  this  in  mind,  we  need  to  pay  close  attention  to  the  balance between the use of, and need for protection of, personal data based on the cultural background and common understanding of society.\n\n## (4) The Principle of Ensuring Security\n\nThe active use of AI automates many social systems and greatly improves safety. On the other hand, at least within the scope of currently available technologies, it is not always possible  for  AI  to  respond  appropriately  to  rare  events  or  deliberate  attacks. Therefore, the use of AI poses a new set of risks to security. Society should always be aware of the balance between the benefits and risks, and endeavor to improve social safety and sustainability as a whole.\n\n- \uf0d8 Society must promote broad, deep research and development related to AI (from immediate measures to deep essential understanding), such as the proper assessment of risks in the utilization of AI and research to reduce risks. Society must make firm efforts to conduct risk management including the safeguard of cybersecurity.\n- \uf0d8 Society should always pay attention to sustainability in the use of AI Society, in particular, must not be uniquely dependent on just one type of AI or a few specific types of AI.\n\n## (5) The Principle of Fair Competition\n\nA fair competitive environment must be maintained in order to create new businesses and services, to maintain sustainable economic growth, and to present solutions to social challenges.\n\n- \uf0d8 Even if resources related to AI are concentrated in a specific country, we must not have a society where unfair data collection and  infringement of sovereignty are performed under that country's dominant position.\n- \uf0d8 Even if resources related to AI are concentrated into specific companies, we must\n\nnot have a society where unfair data collection and unfair competition take place using their dominant position.\n\n- \uf0d8 The use of AI should not generate a situation where wealth and social influence are unfairly biased towards certain stakeholders.\n- (6) The Principle of Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency\n\nIn  an  \"AI-Ready  Society\",  it  is  necessary  to  ensure  fairness  and  transparency  in decision-making, appropriate accountability for the results, and trust in the technology, so that people who use AI are not subject to undue discrimination with regard to personal background, or to unfair treatment in terms of human dignity.\n\n- \uf0d8 Under  AI's  design  concept,  all  people  are  treated  fairly  without  unjustified discrimination  on  the  grounds  of  diverse  backgrounds  such  as  race,  gender, nationality, age, political beliefs, religion, and so on.\n- \uf0d8 Appropriate explanations should be given on a case-by-case basis depending on the application of AI and each particular situation, including such things as when AI is being used, how the AI data is obtained and used, and what measures have been taken to ensure the appropriateness of results obtained from AI operations.\n- \uf0d8 In order for people to understand AI's proposals and make judgments on them, there should be appropriate opportunities for an open dialogue, as required, regarding the use, adoption, and operation of AI.\n- \uf0d8 Taking into account the above viewpoints and in order to use AI safely in society, a  mechanism  must  be  established  to  ensure  trust  in  AI,  and  in  the  data  and algorithms that support it.\n- (7) The Principle of Innovation\n- \uf0d8 To realize Society 5.0 and aim for continuous innovation that advances as people evolve  together  with  AI  development,  we  should  transcend  boundaries  such  as national borders, industries, academia, governments, race, gender, nationality, age, political convictions and religion. We should promote total globalization, diversification,  and  industry-academia-government  cooperation  in  both  human resources and research, based on a wide range of knowledge, perspectives, ideas, and so on.\n- \uf0d8 We must promote equal collaboration among universities, research institutions and companies, and the flexible movement of human resources.\n- \uf0d8 To implement AI efficiently and safely in society, methods for confirming the quality and reliability of AI, and for efficient collection and maintenance of data used by AI must be promoted. In addition to establishing AI engineering such as methods for the development, testing and operation of AI, it is necessary to promote the establishment and development of a wide range of studies such as ethical and economic aspects of AI.\n- \uf0d8 To  ensure  the  sound  development  of  AI  technology,  while  securing  privacy  and\n\nsecurity, it is necessary to establish a platform environment where data from all fields can be  effectively  utilized  across  national  borders  without  being  monopolized.  In addition, to promote research on AI, R&amp;D environments should be established where computer resources and high-speed networks that promote international collaboration and accelerate AI are shared and used.\n\n- \uf0d8 The government must proceed with regulatory reforms to reduce impeding factors in all related fields in order to establish an efficient and beneficial society with the aid of AI technologies.\n\n## 4.2 AI R&amp;D and Utilization Principles\n\nWe believe that developers and business operators of AI should establish and comply with the AI development and utilization principles based on the fundamental philosophy and social principles of AI outlined above.\n\nSince many countries, organizations, companies, and so on are currently discussing AI development and utilization principles, we believe it is important to create an international consensus  quickly  through  open  discussions,  and  share  results  internationally  in  a  nonregulatory, non-binding framework.\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nIn order to lead the world in building the first \"AI-Ready Society,\" Japan should share the principles herein with the government, related industries, organizations, and so on, and reflect them in government policies.\n\nIn addition, Japan should share these principles with other countries around the world and take a leadership role in international discussions with the goal of establishing an AI-Ready Society worldwide. In doing so, Japan should present to the world a social image of Society 5.0 that supports the realization of the SDGs, and should contribute to cooperative and creative new development of the international community.\n\nThese principles should be flexibly revised in the future according to the progress of AIrelated technologies, social changes, changes in the world situation, and many other factors.\n\n## Establishment of the \"Council for Social Principles of Human-centric AI\"\n\nFebruary 15, 2019\n\nAI Strategy Expert Meeting for Strength and Promotion of the Innovation Decision\n\n- 1.  The  \"Council  for  Social  Principles  of  Human-centric  AI\"  (hereinafter  the  \"Council\")  is established,  under  the  AI  Strategy  Expert  Meeting  for  Strength  and  Promotion  of  the Innovation, for the purpose of examining the basic principles for implementing and sharing AI in a better way and reflecting it in AI strategy.

On the one hand, it is hard to argue that Japan possesses adequate competitiveness with regard to AI technology.\n\nOn the other hand, Japan, along with pursuing Society 5.0 1 and contributing to the solution of global issues  (SDGs 2 ),  aims  to  create  a  \"Circulating  and  Ecological  Economy 3 ,\"  as  a  model  for  practical implementation in the field of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).    And Japan must take action in advance of other countries to resolve many social issues faced by a mature society such as an aging population, shrinking population and deterioration of infrastructure.    These issues are not problems that can be solved with technologies such as AI, but it is necessary to coordinate technology and social mechanisms  in  a  transformational  way  in  order  to  realize  a  \"sustainable  society  that  incorporates diversity\".\n\nAt  the March  2017  Artificial Intelligence  Technology  Strategy  Council  meeting,  Japanese government drew up the Artificial Intelligence Technology Strategy and its Industrialization Roadmap, which  designates \"productivity,\" \"health, medical  care, and  long-term  care,\" \"mobility,\"  and \"information security\" as core areas of focus, where the public and private sectors will collaborate on\n\n1 The 5 th Science and Technology Basic Plan states \"We will provide the necessary things and services to people who need them, and when necessary, respond precisely to the various needs of society, providing high quality services for all people, creating a society where all people can receive high-quality services and can live actively and comfortably, overcoming various differences in age, gender, region, and language.\"    The Comprehensive Strategy on Science, Technology and Innovation 2017 states \"Cyber and Physical Spaces should be highly integrated to provide products and services that meet the diverse needs and potential needs without disparities due to things such as region, age, gender, or language.    This is a human-centric society that can balance economic development and social issues, and allow people to live comfortable, vibrant, high-quality lives.\"\n\n2 Sustainable Development Goals: The international goals from 2016 to 2030 described in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted at the UN Summit in September of 2015, consisting of 17 goals and 169 targets to realize a sustainable world, and pledge to leave no one on earth behind.\n\n3 In the 5 th Basic Environment Plan (April 17, 2018 Cabinet Decision) \"This Plan aims to create a \"Circulating and Ecological Economy' that produces new value chains, complements and supports regional resources by building broader networks, which is composed of natural connections (connections among forests, the countryside, rivers and the sea) and, economic connections (composed of human resources, funds, and others), while making full use of mountainous, agricultural and fishing villages, and cities.    Each region will demonstrate its strengths by utilizing its unique characteristics, thereby building a self-reliant and decentralized society where different resources are circulated within each region, and symbiosis and exchange with neighboring regions according to unique characteristics of each region.\"\n\nAI technology spanning the full pipeline from R&amp;D to social implementation.    In August of 2018, an action plan oriented towards further embodying and strengthening the government's efforts based on this Strategy was put together; the action plan specifies the objectives and timetable for accomplishment for each initiative.    However, with regard to the deployment of AI technology in domains such as big data,  there  has  been  an  increasingly  fierce  battle  for  supremacy  over  the  last  few  years  among companies  based  in  certain  countries,  notably  the  US  and  China,  along  with  various  disruptive innovations in various fields that defy conventional projections of advances, all of which has left Japan in a position of having falling behind.    Conversely, some hold the view that because the extent of potential fields for introducing AI technology is so wide, competition in areas such as data collection and utilization in the field has just begun, and the decisive contest is yet to come.\n\nGiven this, in order to take the next step forward in overcoming issues facing Japan, making use of Japan's  strengths  to  open  up  opportunities  for  the  future,  we  will  focus  on  measures  that  Japanese government should immediately take concerted action on, which are summarized in this Strategy.\n\n## I. Basic Concept\n\n## (A) Scope of the Strategy\n\nThe term \"Artificial Intelligence (hereinafter AI)\" in this Strategy presumes a system that realizes an intelligent function 4 .\n\n4 AI (artificial intelligence), for example, in the EC High-Level Expert Group report, it is considered as \"a system that performs intelligent operations (sometimes with certain autonomy) in response to environment and input\", however, the substance of \"intelligent action\" also has an aspect that depends on interpretation.    Also, the AI-100 report published in the US in 2016, cites the definition of Nils J. Nilsson that AI as a field of study is \"research that makes intelligent machines, and intelligence works properly with some kind of insight in the environment where it is placed\", but this definition has great ambiguity.    In fact, in the same report, the vague definition of AI itself has a positive aspect that is accelerating AI research.    In light of these circumstances, although there is a certain consensus regarding whether to judge something as \"AI\" or \"AI technology\", it is not meaningful to define it more strictly on the basis of the technology, etc. used there.    At the same time, it should be noted that such a system is incorporated into a highly complex system.    Furthermore, implementation of the AI system cannot be realized without the necessary infrastructure for large-scale data collection and storage, infrastructure access, ultra-high-speed communication networks, sensors, robots, and the like.    Without the development and implementation of technology that ensures the safety and soundness of such systems, such as cyber security and AI ethics, it will be difficult for AI to be widely accepted.    AI encompasses a wide range of systems that realize functions considered to be intelligent and is expected to extend into all domains, ranging from the society and industry of the future to daily life, scientific research and technology development. Accordingly, this strategy must address planning for all these domains in an integrated manner.\n\nAlthough AI in recent years is mainly based on machine learning, especially deep learning, AI related technology is rapidly developing, and the definition of AI is not limited solely to technology used for AI.\n\n## (B) Purpose of the Strategy\n\nThe purpose of this Strategy is to specify the environment and measures conducive to effective future utilization of AI for the purposes of contributing to the solution of global issues through realization of Society 5.0 and overcoming the issues facing Japanese society.\n\nThis Strategy establishes an integrated policy package for AI that encompasses educational reform, research  and  development  (R&amp;D)  and  social  implementation  in  order  to  contribute  to  the  world, overcome challenges, and ultimately improve Japan's industrial competitiveness.\n\n## (C) Principles behind the Strategy\n\nIn March of 2019, the government compiled the \"Social Principles of Human-Centric AI.\"\n\nThis document specifies the form of society that Japan should aim for, a multilateral framework, and a policy direction that the national and local governments should aim for as AI develops. It defines three points as its basic principles:\n\n- (i) Dignity - A society in which human dignity is respected\n- (ii) Diversity and Inclusion - A society in which people with diverse backgrounds can pursue their own well-being.\n- (iii) Sustainability - A sustainable society.\n\nThis Strategy respects these basic principles.\n\n## (D) Basic Concept for Strategy Promotion\n\nIn order to realize the basic principles of section (C) above, that is, to have a \"sustainable society that incorporates  diversity\",  it  is  important  to  introduce  new  technologies  including AI  in  parallel  with reforming social systems.    Furthermore, it is essential that the introduction of AI yield benefits that are tangible to individual citizens and that new technologies and social systems are widely accepted.\n\nIn addition, while moving forward with the implementation of Society 5.0, Japan must improve its international presence and radically strengthen its industrial competitiveness.    In doing so, as laid out in the \"Social Principles of Human-Centric AI,\" it is important for diverse human resources, regardless\n\nof their diverse backgrounds in terms of gender, age, political beliefs, and religion to be able to contribute based on a wide range of knowledge, perspectives, ideas, and so on.\n\nThe government, as the overall coordinator, bearing in mind the above-mentioned points, needs to steadily promote the various measures described in this Strategy while maintaining full awareness of the following points.\n\n- (i) The main players in industry are private sector companies, and for these companies to exercise their full capabilities, factors such as provision of foundations (training and recruiting of human resources, promotion of R&amp;D, maintenance of the industrial base and support for commercialization),  the  establishment  of  a  system  to  accelerate  the  introduction  of  new technologies  and  removal  of  impeding  factors,  and  the  establishment  of  a  multinational framework are essential.\n- (ii)  Implementation of the AI system requires, for example, large-scale data collection and storage, infrastructure for access, ultra-high-speed communication networks, sensor clusters, and robots.\n- (iii) In  order  to  achieve  the  social  acceptance  of AI,  it  is  important  to  develop  and  implement technology, including cyber security and AI ethics, that ensures system safety and integrity; to improve literacy related to AI; to have appropriate communication between developers/operators and users; and to foster recognition of the tangible benefits of AI.\n\n## (E) Strategic Objectives\n\nThe following strategic objectives are set for this Strategy.\n\n## Strategic Objective 1\n\nFor Japan to develop a base of human resources which, in proportion to population, leads the world in being aligned with the needs of the AI era, and to become a country that attracts human resources from around the world.    In addition, to build a mechanism to achieve this objective on a sustainable basis.\n\n\"Human resources aligned with the needs of the AI era\" are not a uniform type of person.    They may be divided into various categories, such as\n\n- \u30fb People who carry out advanced AI research;\n- \u30fb People who apply AI to industry;\n\n- \u30fb People who realize application in small and medium-sized businesses;\n- \u30fb People engaged in new business creation using AI;\n\nHowever categorized, each category needs to have a deep talent pool.\n\nIn  order  to  deepen  the  talent  pool,  it  is  important  to  have  strategies  to  develop  and  attract  people according to their needs, including diverse human resources including women and people from overseas who aspire to work in Japan.    Therefore, in the future, it will be important to establish a leading-edge education programs, and further, it will be necessary to enhance it to a level that can be offered overseas as well.\n\nIn daily life, more effective use of AI improves the convenience of life and enables people to do things that could not have been done without AI.    However, in order to do so, it is necessary to raise people's literacy  of AI  and  make  it  possible  for  each  individual  to  appreciate  and  utilize  the  benefits  of AI willingly and without anxiety.\n\n## Strategic Objective 2\n\n## For Japan to become a frontrunner in the application of AI to real-world industry and to achieve strengthened industrial competitiveness.\n\nThe \"real world industry\" 5 domain encompasses value-generating activities which cannot be fully executed within cyberspace, but only by interactions among people, nature, hardware, etc.    This domain contains a vast amount of information that has not yet been systematically acquired.\n\nIn this domain, because in many cases it is extremely important to promote the transition to high valueadded industries centered on service platforms, we aim to improve Japan's industrial competitiveness and secure and maintain a position as a frontrunner in the world by promoting AI related development support,  system  design,  and  laying  of  foundations  for  social  implementation  that  contributes  to  this transition.    This is an objective to be realized in conjunction with policies other than AI strategy, but there AI strategy unquestionably plays an important part.    Labor productivity can be considered as a\n\n5 A generic term for industries that provide some value in the physical real world, such as medicine, agriculture, materials, logistics, and manufacturing equipment.    In contrast to SNS and search services, it is characterized as not being completed within cyberspace, but creates value for the first time through interaction with people, nature, hardware, etc.\n\nmeasure of industrial  competitiveness.    As  a  reference,  in  order  to  reach  labor  productivity  levels 6 equivalent to those of other countries such as the US, Germany and France within the next 10 years or so, Japan must maintain a nominal labor productivity growth rate of over 6% for 10 years, making it clear that a very bold change in industrial structure is necessary. And concurrently, through this domain Japan can contribute to the achievement of SDGs on a global scale.\n\nIn addition, it is also important to aim at further improvement of service quality, improvement of the working environment, and ultimately the reduction of fiscal burdens by applying AI in the public service sector.\n\nNote that the type of service industries that are almost completely in cyberspace, such as e-commerce and SNS, are a subject for future study.\n\n## Strategic Objective 3\n\nFor a series of technology systems to be established in Japan that will realize a \" sustainable society that incorporates diversity \" , and to implement a mechanism to operate them.\n\nIt is extremely important for women, foreigners, elderly people and other diverse people with diverse backgrounds to be able to fully participate in society while enjoying diverse lifestyles.    We will promote the establishment of AI-related diverse technology systems along with the creation of social systems and mechanisms to use them with the aim of individual citizen being able to enjoy tangible benefits.\n\nIn  addition, this strategic objective is not intended to be limited in scope by Japan's borders; it is important to formulate a plan for implementation on the premise that promoting this objective on a global scale can significantly contribute to the achievement of SDGs.\n\n## Strategic Objective 4\n\nFor Japan to take a leadership role in building international research, education, and social infrastructure  networks  in  the AI  field,  and  to  accelerate AI-related  R&amp;D,  human  resource development, achievement of SDGs, etc.\n\n6 Nominal labor productivity (per hour) of major countries in 2017: US $72.0 USD, Germany $69.8, France $67.8, Japan $47.5 (all converted to purchasing power parity) (Source: Japan Productivity Foundation Headquarters \"International Comparison of Labor Productivity in 2018\").\n\nWith  economic  and  social  globalization  rapidly  advancing,  objectives  such  as AI  related  human resource development/provision and industrial development cannot be fully accomplished solely within Japan,  so  we  must  always  maintain  an  international  perspective.    For  example,  in  human  resource development and provision, it is necessary to provide many venues for overseas researches and engineers to be active in Japan, and to increase joint R&amp;D and joint projects between Japan and foreign countries. For this reason, in addition to strengthening collaboration with research and education institutions and companies in North America and Europe, we will fully engage in collaborations with regions having future growth prospects such as ASEAN, India, the Middle East, and Africa.    We will provide AI related education programs to these areas, and take the opportunity of TICAD7 (Yokohama) to contribute to the promotion of AI research and commercialization in those areas.    To achieve this, the core centers of the AI Research and Development Network, etc., in each priority area will need to clarify plans for which areas in which to conduct world-leading research and, with respect to emergent research, how to draw on an international talent pool in order to maintain the diversity of human resources and themes.\n\nAdditionally, in fields such as health, medical care, and long-term care, agriculture, and smart cities, we aim for international collaboration and cooperation at a scale that offers mutual advantages in terms of human resources, data and markets.\n\n## (F) Role Sharing Between Public and Private Sectors\n\nA unified effort between the public and private sectors is essential to realize this Strategy.\n\nAmong these, by carrying out the following activities, the government 1will maintain an environment for the creation of a new society for the future (Society 5.0) and assiduously support private sector efforts towards the renovation of Japan's industrial structure through activities such as improving productivity, creating diverse value, and launching clusters of start-up companies.\n\n- \uf0d8 Development of strategy and formulation of a roadmap to realize it\n- \uf0d8 Immediate removal of institutional and policy obstacles\n- \uf0d8 Establishing networks for problem solving among multiple stakeholders\n- \uf0d8 Development of human resources including domestic and foreign workers\n- \uf0d8 Social implementation of social structure transformation and measures for the survival of the nation\n- \uf0d8 Fundamental R&amp;D, next generation basic research\n- \uf0d8 Provision of a common environment for acceleration of AI utilization\n- \uf0d8 Ethics, formation of national and international governance systems\n- \uf0d8 Creation of a \"global network\" hub\n\nIt is necessary for the private sector, on the other hand, with full understanding of the purpose of this Strategy, to comply with the Social Principles of AI and to pursue international collaboration with other countries/regions  and  cooperation  with  diverse  stakeholders  while  introducing  an  internationally competitive compensation system for talented human resources.    Furthermore, for the sake of jointly creating the future, the private sector must actively contribute to future economic and social development with the awareness of their core role in undertaking a major challenge.\n\n## II. Building a Foundation for the Future: Education Reform and Reconstruction of the Research and Development System\n\n## II-1 Education Reform\n\nCurrently, our society is undergoing a major transition through digital transformation.    One of the major driving forces of this change is AI, and there is the increasing demand for human resources capable of creating and using AI, designing new ways of society (a \"sustainable society that incorporates diversity\"), designing products and services suitable for the new society and creating new value.    It is no exaggeration to say that this, coupled with the ability to collect, store and analyze big data, is one of the biggest factors determining the vitality of society and industry in the future. For this reason, the training and securing of related human resources is an urgent and a long-term issues including primary and secondary, higher, recurrent 7 and lifelong education.    Above all, it is important to have the ability to design new ways of society, products and services, based on the knowledge and skills related to \"mathematics, data science and AI\" and on humanities, social sciences and arts education.    It will be essential to have radical improvement of traditional methods of education, introduce and strengthen new methods such as STEAM education 8 , and perform crossdisciplinary learning for problem solving in the world.\n\nAdditionally, it is essential to have a strong understanding of the relationship between various social issues and science and mathematics from an early stage, and the experience of thinking to solve them with science and mathematics.    In order to achieve this, it is also necessary to rapidly develop ICT infrastructure in schools, including an information education environment for each child student, and a school affairs support system for education.\n\nFurthermore, if Japan can build new education model for mathematics, data science, and AI in the age of Society 5.0 in advance of other countries, it will be possible to strongly disseminate it to the world, especially to the Asian region.\n\n7 This is education for working members of society, especially professionals, after completion of their regular schooling, and includes not only full-time re-education, but also includes part-time education while working.\n\n8 Cross-disciplinary education used to apply learning in individual disciplines including Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics to problem solving in the real world.\n\n## \uff1c Main Objectives \uff1e\n\nThe following goals for future education are set keeping in mind their realization by 2025, with the aim for human resources to be active in all fields of society and for all citizens to be cultivated the  capability  to  participate  in  creating  a  sustainable  society,  the  power  which  includes  the knowledge and skills related to \"Mathematics, Data Science, and AI\", as the basic knowledge of the  digital  society  (like  the  so-called  \"Reading,  Writing, Abacus\"  basics),  and  the  basic  skills necessary to design new ways of society, products and services.:\n\n- \uf09e For all senior high school graduates to acquire basic literacy in \"Science and Mathematics, Data  Science,  and AI\".

Combined with the relative decline of the Japanese economy in the global economy, it has now become difficult for Japan to conduct a domestic-only agenda for various AI related technology R&amp;D.    Moreover, this is also contributing to a delay in deployment of AI in complex sectors such as manufacturing, medical practice and mobility.\n\nIn Japan, there is a history of basic research, general-purpose research, and applied research in each sector developing independently in a decentralized fashion.    While they have formed a group of AIrelated core centers 20 with excellent capabilities in certain basic research, and public research institutes that have an excellent track record of applied research in specific fields, it is undeniable that there have been few crossover activities between them.    From now on, in order to further improve Japan's AI related  research  capabilities  and  push  forward  with  social  implementation  of  research  results,  it  is important for all the research institutes to cooperate and complement each other while demonstrating their own strengths, making it necessary to establish a R&amp;D network centered on AI related core centers.\n\nAmong these, each AI-related core center is expected to continue to produce world-class results in each priority area and to become an international hub. So far, the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP) has been researching and developing innovative fundamental technologies centering on theoretical research and integrally advancing them to the social implementation stage; the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT)  is  engaged  in  R&amp;D  focusing  on  natural  language  processing,  multilingual  translation,\n\n20 Includes the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN) Center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology AI Research Center (AIST AIRC), National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Universal Communication Research Institute (UCRI), and the Center for Information and Neural Networks (CiNet)\n\nmultilingual  speech  processing,  cognitive  model  building  of  the  brain,  and  provision  and  social implementation of a usage environment including stored data; and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial  Science  and  Technology  (AIST) AI  Research  Center  (AIRC)  has  mainly  pursued  social implementation  centered  on  bridging  (the  practical  application  side)  to  companies  with  superior AI technology.    Moving  forward,  RIKEN  AIP  aims  to  be  the  world  leader  in  R&amp;D  of  innovative fundamental  technologies  centering  on  AI  theoretical  research,  NICT  aims  for  the  realization  of interactive technology through innovative natural language processing using large-scale data, developing multilingual  translation  and  speech  processing  technology  including  handling  of  foreign visitors from Asia and foreigners residing in Japan, and being the world's top leader in construction and application of a cognitive model of the brain aiming at the realization of heart-to-heart communication, and AIST AIRC aims to lead the world as the core research organization bridging AI based technology and society to real-world applications of AI. Additionally, each AI-related core center aims to rapidly transfer research results to find uses in society.\n\nOn the other hand, on the front lines of R&amp;D, there is an urgency to deal with new issues such as ensuring the quality of AI, securing the reliability of the entire network, and responding to cyber-attacks. In order to respond to these issues, not only the linear extension of R&amp;D conducted up until now, but also  new  engineering  approaches  and  cross-disciplinary  approaches  are  indispensable,  as  is  quickly pivoting away from follow-up research that loses sight of Japan's strengths.\n\nFirst of all, in order to make use of Japan's strengths and to revitalize Japan's future, (i) development of AI for the real-world domain and (ii) AI designed for inclusion will be the two major pillars of R&amp;D. It is essential to construct a technological system aligned with these pillars, to push forward with basic research,  and  then  advance  to  application  and  implementation.    Additionally,  as  a  premise  of  these pillars, it is important for Japan to establish a stack of technologies and operational know-how to develop AI with a high and reliable level of quality (Trusted Quality AI).    This is important both in terms of reflecting the principles in the \"Social Principles of Human-Centric AI\" and in terms of establishing a competitive advantage.\n\nIn the application of AI to the real world domain, it is important to establish the theory, technology base, and  development  and  operation  process  that  will  make  the  development  of  an  effective AI  system possible under the constraints of data of very high dimensionality with inaccuracy and incompleteness,\n\nand in many cases, where a sufficient amount of data cannot be obtained.    In addition, since the AI system is a system integrated with sensors, IoT, robots, infrastructure, etc., it is important to have a technology base on which these systems can easily be built.    It is necessary to establish a R&amp;D system that views the process in terms of the full pipeline from research results to social implementation.\n\nAdditionally, the cluster of technologies that support the realization of diversity and social inclusion, called \"inclusion technology\", has among its aims to realize the principles of universal design within a large framework linked to the pursuit of R&amp;D oriented towards the development and implementation of inclusion technology and the realization of institutional reforms and digital government.    At the present time, inclusion technology is not a well-established concept, and due to the nature of meeting diverse needs of diverse people, is not a single technology but rather a collection of diverse technologies.    For this  reason,  it  is  necessary  to  identify  technology,  operation  and  organizational  universality  and  to establish  a  new  technology  system.    As  an  emergent  research  field,  inclusion  technology,  while focusing on a number of themes with obvious applications, must at the same time progress towards creating diverse solutions for diverse needs.\n\nFurthermore, when viewed from the perspective of medium and long-term innovation, it is critical to have emerging research oriented toward creating new value that cannot be predicted at the present stage, generating diverse seeds, and spurring cross-disciplinary integration at the basic research stage.\n\nConsequently, we emphasize the diversity of R&amp;D and set up the following four R&amp;D approaches (programs):\n\n- (i) Basic research on AI and development of foundational technologies (AI Core)\n- (ii) R&amp;D on applying AI to real-world industries\n- (iii) R&amp;D on achieving inclusion through AI\n- (iv) Emerging research to pioneer blue-sky fields and technologies arising from a diversity of ideas\n\nAmong these, approaches (i) to (iii) are strategic programs, that is, programs based on recognition and prediction of technology trends, issues in Japan, and future directions, and are premised on a certain course of action and scenarios.    In addition, (ii) and (iii) have aspects that require research based on diversity in problem identification and ideas, and a certain percentage will be implemented as a themeoriented emergent research program.\n\nThe emergent research in approach (iv) should be a program that imposes no constraints on research content,  based  on  the  fact  that  research  that  leads  to  many  disruptive  innovations  is  actually  being generated  from  non-focused  areas.    At  the  same  time,  it  is  necessary  to  design  programs  with  an emphasis on diversity, under the hypothesis that emergent research is created from the integration of diverse human resources and disciplines.    Also, in this context, it is necessary to establish a globally attractive system design and operation system.\n\nIn view of the difficulty of Japan going it alone in conducting various AI related technology R&amp;D, we will make up for the shortage of domestic human resources in the future by attracting and exchanging international human resources, therefore recruitment and management of programs must be conducted in English.\n\n## \uff1c Main Objectives \uff1e\n\n- \uf09e Building of a comprehensive R&amp;D cycle spanning basic research through social implementation in accord with

Establishing a Foundation for Industry and Society\n\n## III - 1 Social Implementation\n\nAs already emphasized, by combining Japan's technology strengths with AI technology, we must aim to realize a \"sustainable society that incorporates diversity\" while contributing to the solution of global issues,  creating  substantial  added  value,  improving  productivity,  and  further  strengthening  industrial competitiveness.\n\nIn  particular,  the  real-world  industry  domain  is  an  area  where  Japanese  companies  have  a  large presence in the world at present.    Consequently, Japan should be able to demonstrate superiority and take leadership in the realization of application of AI technology to the real-world industry domain (AI for Real World) and inclusion (AI for Inclusion).\n\nHowever, in developing and deploying AI systems for the real-world industry domain, it is essential to  provide  domain-specific  expertise  and  know-how,  as  well  as  deal  with  case-by-case  factors, including operation.    For this reason, in the current situation where the source of value has shifted to the service platform, settling for business models that are simply an extension of linear trends up to the present could result in Japanese industry losing preeminence, as hardware and other devices become terminals of service platforms,\n\nAt this point, first of all, as a sector-wide effort, in order to promote structural transformation to high value-added service industries (as measured by GDP per Capita, etc.) centered on AI-driven services and to dramatically improve productivity, it is necessary to develop architecture-based technology and form social implementation infrastructure.\n\nFurthermore, the individual optimization of each domain is not enough; a system architecture must be designed  to  promote  social  implementation  across  fields.    Designing  such  an  architecture  requires highly specialized system engineering expertise and experience; unfortunately, there is a critical shortage of such experts in Japan.    For that reason, it is necessary to build a cross-ministerial promotion system, in reference to the efforts of organizations such as the United States' NIST 25 , and working in cooperation\n\n25 National Institute of Standards and Technology\n\nwith relevant organizations in other countries, deploy Japan's limited number of specialists to conduct carry out system architecture design more efficiently and promote standardization.\n\nThe five areas of health, medical care, and long-term care, agriculture, national resilience (to disasters), transportation infrastructure and logistics, and regional revitalization are designated as priority areas.\n\nThis is because Japan's top priority is finding solutions to social issues the country is facing, such as being the first country to face the full-blown effects of a declining birthrate and an aging population along with the resulting rapid increase in social security costs; decline in the workforce and shortage of healthcare  and  long-term  care  workers;  extreme  aging  population  of  the  agricultural  workforce;  the increase in disasters and damage to agriculture, forestry and fisheries due to climate change and extreme weather;  and  the  aging  and  deterioration  of  infrastructure  and  the  shortage  of  human  resources  to maintain infrastructure in regional Japan.\n\nIn the health, medical care, and long-term care fields, the medium and long term goal is to achieve better health for the public, improved levels of medical and long-term care, and an improved working environment for health-related workers while simultaneously reducing the burden on taxpayers.\n\nIn the area of regional revitalization (smart cities), this Strategy has foremost in mind regional cities (without excluding large cities).    First of all, it is important to improve the quality of life in regional cities and regions and to nurture the development of local industries, but at the same time, aim to reduce the burden on local government finances.\n\nIn  doing  so,  rather  than  prioritizing  the  logic  of  the  infrastructure  and  service  providers,  the perspectives of diverse residents and local businesses should be emphasized.    This approach is firmly rooted in the principle of \"a sustainable society that incorporates diversity\", and is expected to contribute to the realization of high value-added services in the region.\n\nIn addition, once social implementation of these five domains is realized in Japan, the high valueadded services they generate can be expanded overseas, with unquestionable potential to contribute to the solution of global SDGs.\n\n## \uff1c Main Objectives \uff1e\n\nTo bring together the wisdom of industry, academia and government, setting the following goals, with the building of a framework for sustainable social implementation in mind:\n\n- \uf09e Based on a data infrastructure grounded in architecture design, being at the forefront globally in achieving AI social implementation in five key areas: (i) health, medical care and longterm  care; (ii) agriculture; (iii) national resilience (to disasters); (iv) transportation infrastructure  and  logistics;  and  (v)  regional  revitalization  (smart  cities). In  addition, undertaking efforts to achieve social implementation in manufacturing, finance and other fields\n- \uf09e Promotion of participation of private sector actors in social implementation models for each domain  (including  studying  the  prospects  for  rolling  out  the  entire  system  in  overseas markets)\n- \uf09e In  health,  medical  care,  and  long-term  care  fields,  maintaining  an  environment  in  which people feel assured that they can receive the most advanced and effective treatments as wells as high quality long-term care regardless of location, reducing the burden on medical care and long-term care providers\n- \uf09e In the agricultural sector, almost all the business farmers utilizing data in their workflow by 2025\n- \uf09e In the domain of national resilience, introducing a nationwide system to ensure the safety of infrastructure while minimizing maintenance and repair costs, and managing and sharing all types of data related to Japan's territory for that purpose\n- \uf09e In  the  transportation  infrastructure  and  logistics  domain,  exploring how to build the data infrastructure for distribution and logistics; improving productivity and increase added value in logistics and efficiency improvement of the entire supply chain by linking with other data infrastructures,  automation,  etc.;  enabling  all  people  to  enjoy  freedom  of  movement  and safety while doing so, without exceeding current social costs\n- \uf09e In the regional revitalization (smart city) domain, coordination with other domains such as agriculture and health, medical care, and long-term care, adoption of inclusion technology and building a smart city model that can also be rolled out to overseas markets.\n\n## \uff1c Specific

Ethics\n\nWhile interest in utilization of AI is increasing, an excessive pursuit of making life in our civilization ever more convenient could amplify the negative ramifications of AI.    In order to minimize this, a high ethical perspective that reflects the cultural background is important, and so-called AI social principles are needed in order to promote the use of AI in a way that respects human beings.    In light of these concerns, Japan formulated its Social Principles of AI and announced them in March of 2019; the EU did so in April of the same year.    Subsequently in May of 2019, the OECD Ministerial Council adopted a recommendation on AI and then in June, at the G20 Trade and Digital Economy Ministers' Meeting, agreement was reached on principles for AI around the concept of \"human-centric\".\n\nCurrently, in addition to Japan and the EU, countries such as Canada and Singapore are pursuing similar efforts, and discussions on ethics are also underway within international frameworks such as UNESCO and the G7. We can expect various debates around these issues, including about what new forms society should take, to become more and more active.\n\nAt  the  \"International  Conference  of  Data  Protection  and  Privacy  Commissioners\",  which  brings together experts in the field, discussions about the development of guidelines which adhere to principles of AI ethics and data protection have begun.\n\n## \uff1c Objective \uff1e\n\nDissemination of the Social Principles of AI and establishment of an international collaboration system\n\n## (Initiatives)\n\n- \uf09e Establishment of seven AI social principles on social framework in the AI-Ready society of \" Social Principles of Human-centric AI\" (FY 2020) [CSTI, MIC, MEXT, MHLW, METI]\n- \uf09e Establishment of a multilateral framework on the social principles of AI, including consideration for the prevention of ethics dumping 32   (FY 2021) [CSTI, PPC, MIC, MOFA, MEXT, MHLW, METI]\n\n32 Ethics dumping: Conducting unethical research in countries/regions where ethics rules are loose.\n\n## V.    Miscellaneous\n\nAs previously mentioned, the social and technological contexts surrounding AI have been rapidly changing and developing in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States, China, Europe, Canada, and various Asian countries, have formulated national AI strategies, and in Europe and Asia there has been a surge in international cooperation and international joint R&amp;D among AI research centers in order to carry out these strategies.\n\nJapan must seize the opportunity that such a social environment presents to actively strive to secure international leadership in AI related fields.\n\nIn addition, in light of the fact that Japan is the G20 chair country and TICAD7 will be held in Japan this year, it is important to keep in mind that cooperation with developing countries, where interest in AI is expanding -- especially in Africa -- should be included in the scope.\n\n## \uff1c Main Objective \uff1e\n\nSecuring Japan's leadership role in the international community on AI related technologies\n\n## \uff1c Specific Objective 1 \uff1e\n\nRegular follow-up and review of this Strategy\n\n## (Initiatives)\n\n- \uf09e Building an AI strategy / AI social principles follow-up system in which diverse stakeholders collaborate  (AI  strategy  expert  meeting  for  strength  and  promotion  of  the  innovation), conducting follow-ups, and reviewing this Strategy as needed (FY 2019) [CSTI]\n- \uf09e Examination towards realization of Intellectual  Property systems, etc. to take advantage of Japan's strengths in accordance with the initiatives of this Strategy (FY 2019) [IP, METI]\n\n## \uff1c Specific Objective 2 \uff1e\n\nRaising Japan's global profile in organization, development, implementation, etc.\n\n## (Initiatives)\n\n- \uf09e G20 agreement on collaboration  for AI  ethical  principles  (FY  2019)  [CSTI,  MIC,  MOFA, METI]\n\n- \uf09e Contribution to TICAD7 (Yokohama) regarding AI human resource development, support for social implementation, etc. (FY 2019) [CSTI, MIC, MOFA, METI]\n- \uf09e Packaging AI related data, apps, etc. for international development (FY 2020) [MIC, MHLW, MAFF, METI, MLIT]\n- \uf09e 100 (approx.) top AI researchers/year invitation from around the world to Japan (FY 2020) [MIC, MEXT, METI]\n- \uf09e Attracting and supporting AI related international conferences such as the IJCAI 33 (FY 2020) [CSTI, MIC, MEXT, METI, MLIT]\n\n33 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence: to be held in Yokohama in 2020.\n\n## \uff08 Appended Table 1 \uff09 Core Foundation Research and Development\n\n| Future R&DPriority Items                           | Individual Items                                                                          | Concrete Initiative Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Achievement Period   | Agency   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------|\n| 1.

Japan is the first country to tackle many social issues confronting a mature society, such as the declining birthrate and aging population, labor shortage, rural depopulation, and increased fiscal spending. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is considered a key technology to rescue society from  these  problems,  to  address  the  goals  set  forth  in  the  United  Nation's  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to build a sustainable world.\n\nJapan, with the establishment of Society5.0 1 , whose purpose is to address social issues and economic  development  using  AI,  aims  to  revitalize  its  society  and  economy,  to  be  an internationally attractive society, and to contribute to the SDGs on a global scale.\n\nSimilar to many other types of science and technology, AI will bring many great benefits to society, but its large impact on society calls for appropriate development  and implementation. In order to avoid or reduce the negative aspects in advance while making effective use of AI to benefit society, we should promote, together with the continued research and development (R&amp;D) of technologies related to AI, a transformation into an \"AI-Ready Society\" where AI can be used effectively and safely. We need to redesign society in every way  including  Japan's  human  potential,  social  systems,  industrial  structures,  innovation systems, and governance.\n\nDepending on the researcher, there are various ways of thinking about the definition of AI (Artificial Intelligence), a central theme of this document, and there is no clear definition at present. For example, the EC High-Level Expert Group report 2 defines AI as a system that performs intelligent operations (which may have some autonomy) in response to environment and input. However, the expression \"intelligent operation\" itself is somewhat vague and open for interpretation. Also, the AI100 Report 3 published in the United States in 2016 cites Nils J. Nilsson's definition 4 of AI as a field of research according to which \"Artificial intelligence is that  activity  devoted  to  making  machines  intelligent,  and  intelligence  is  that  quality  that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment\", but this definition is also highly ambiguous. In actuality, the vague definition of AI within the same report in and of itself has a positive side that is accelerating the study of AI. In light of these circumstances, although there is a certain consensus on what to judge as AI or AI technology, it does not appear appropriate at this time to define it more strictly.\n\nIn addition, various technologies normally called \"AI\" are seldom used alone but instead are generally incorporated and used as part of an information system. Advanced and complex\n\n1 Society 5.0 is the future society that Japan aims for, following the Information Society (Society 4.0). A society that realizes Society 5.0 is a sustainable human-centric society that implements AI, IoT (Internet of Things), robotics and other cutting-edge technologies to create unprecedented value, and a wide range of people can realize their own well-being while respecting the well-being of others.\n\n2  High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG), \"Draft Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI\", and \"A definition of AI: Main capabilities and scientific disciplines\", European Commission, Directorate-General for Communication, December 2018.\n\n3 Stone, P., et al., \"Artificial Intelligence and Life 2030. One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence: Report of the 2015-2016 Study Panel\", Stanford University, Stanford, CA, Sept. 2016.\n\n4  Nils J. Nilsson, The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010.\n\ninformation systems may incorporate a broad range of AI technologies; moreover, they may incorporate technologies reflected in the principles stated in this document.  Based on these two premises, the  principles  herein  may  be  regarded  as  applying  to  any  \"highly  complex information systems in general\" that include any such technology. Given such consideration, we do not define a particular technology or system as \"AI\", but regard AI as \"highly complex information systems in general\". After discussing some of the impacts on society, we will present a set of AI social principles and identify some issues to consider in AI R&amp;D and social implementation.  In  order  to  make  the  ensuing  Society  5.0  as  effective  as  possible,  it  is essential for all relevant stakeholders to cooperate and interact closely with each other.\n\n5\n\nFigure 1 shows the overall structure of this document.\n\n## Section 2 Basic Philosophy\n\nDignity: A society that has respect for human dignity\n\nDiversity &amp; Inclusion: A society where people with diverse backgrounds can pursue their well-being\n\nSustainability: A sustainable society\n\nSection 3 Social Changes Needed to Realize Society 5.0 - \"AI-Ready Society 5 \"\n\nHuman Potential, Social Systems, Industrial Structures,\n\nInnovation Systems (environments that support innovation),\n\nGovernance\n\nSection 4 Social Principles of Human-Centric AI\n\n- 4.1 Social Principles of AI\n- (1) Human-Centric, (2) Education/Literacy, (3) Privacy Protection,\n- (4) Ensuring Security, (5) Fair Competition,\n- (6) Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, (7) Innovation\n- 4.2 R&amp;D and Utilization Principles of AI\n\nFigure 1:  Overall Structure of This Document\n\nAn \"AI-Ready Society\" means that society as a whole has undergone the necessary changes to maximize the benefits of AI, enjoys the benefits of AI, or has introduced AI immediately when needed and is in a state of being able to receive the benefits. It means \"a society adapted to the use of AI\". For this purpose, society as a whole needs to be transformed, including individuals, business organizations, and the social innovation environment. Individually, for example, everyone should acquire appropriate AI literacy that allows them to use AI for work and life. In business organizations, meanwhile, corporate activities should be developed with strategies premised on the use of AI. In the social innovation environment, all information should be digitized in a form that allows for AI analysis, should be transformed into data, and should be maintained in a state in which it can be used for AI development and service provision.\n\n## 2 Basic Philosophy\n\nAI is expected to contribute significantly to the realization of Society 5.0. We consider AI important not only to return the benefits obtained from the efficiency and convenience of using AI to people and society, but also to use AI for the public good of humanity as a whole, and to ensure global sustainability outlined in the SDGs through qualitative changes in social conditions and true innovation.\n\nWe believe we should respect the following three values as our philosophy and build a society that pursues their realization.\n\n## (1) Dignity: A society that has respect for human dignity\n\nWe should not build a society where humans are overly dependent on AI or where AI is  used  to  control  human  behavior  through  the  excessive  pursuit  of  efficiency  and convenience. We need to construct a society where human dignity is respected and, by using AI as a tool, a society where people can better demonstrate their various human abilities, show greater creativity, engage in challenging work, and live richer lives both physically and mentally.\n\n- (2) Diversity &amp; Inclusion: A society where people with diverse backgrounds can pursue their own well-being\n\nIt  is  both an ideal in the modern world and a major challenge to create a society in which people with diverse backgrounds, values and ways of thinking can pursue their own well-being while society creates new value by flexibly embracing them. AI is a technology powerful enough to bring us closer to this ideal. We need to change the nature of society in this way through the appropriate development and deployment of AI.\n\n## (3) Sustainability: A sustainable society\n\nWe need to use AI to create a succession of new businesses and solutions, resolve social disparities,  and  develop  a  sustainable  society  that  can  deal  with  issues  such  as  global environmental problems and climate change. Japan, as a leading science and technologyoriented country, has an obligation to strengthen its accumulated  scientific  and technological resources by utilizing AI and thereby contributing to the creation of such a sustainable society.\n\n## 3 Social Changes Needed to Realize Society 5.0  \"AI-Ready Society\"\n\nTechnologies  expected  to  contribute  to  the  realization  of  Society  5.0  include  AI,  IoT, Robotics,  and  ultra-high-speed  broadband  communication  networks.  Even  if  it  becomes possible to some extent to entrust complex processes to machines using AI, it is still necessary for humans to set objectives that answer the question \"What are we using AI for?\"  While AI can be used to better society, it might also be used for undesirable purposes or in inappropriate ways unconsciously. For this reason, we are advancing technological developments in terms of  Human  Potential,  Social  Systems, Industrial Structures, Innovation  Systems,  and Governance which can answer the question \"What are we using AI for?\" while paying close attention to their interaction with the progress of technology.  These five aspects are equally important in achieving Society 5.0.\n\n## (1) Human Potential\n\nIn an \"AI-Ready Society\" that is responsive to the spread of AI to every corner of society, how human beings respond to AI is the key to realizing a society where AI can be fully utilized. To that end, the expected abilities and roles of people are as follows.\n\n- A) People should fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of AI. In particular, people should have the ability to recognize that biases are included in the algorithms and/or data that will become the information resources of AI, and for example, that these biases may be used for undesirable purposes.  In addition, people should recognize that there are three types of data bias: statistical bias, bias caused by social conditions, and bias arising from malicious intent among AI users.\n- B) It is preferred that the use of AI will create an environment in which many people can engage in highly creative and productive work. To that end, it is expected that a diverse range of people will acquire the ability to realize their own dreams and ideas with AI's support despite many differences in origin, culture, taste, and so on. An education system that achieves these goals as well as social systems that contribute to their achievement must be realized.\n- C) It  is  important  to  have  sufficient  human  resources  with  acquired  application  skills  such  as implementation and design of AI systems and a basic knowledge of data and AI. These skills would  be  acquired  in  a  cross-disciplinary  range  of  fields  in  a  combined  and  integrated framework. It is expected that such human resources will be the driving force of all activities in society, and that the capabilities of those people will contribute to the formation of an AI-based living environment. Given the establishment of such a living environment, we must implement social systems that allow many people to live a richer and more fulfilling life.\n\n## (2) Social Systems\n\nThe use of AI will most likely accelerate the evolution of individual service solutions and create various benefits from improved efficiency and individualization. In order to embrace the full benefits of  this  change  in  society,  it  is  necessary  for  entire  social  systems  including  health  care,  finance, insurance, transportation, energy, and others to flexibly change and respond to the evolution of AI. This includes simple efficiency in light of existing socially accepted objectives (such as improved convenience and liberation from simple labor tasks). It  also  includes  the  realization  of  new  value potentially created by diversification and fluidization of objectives and resolving negative outcomes (such as inequality, widening disparity, social exclusion, and so on) that may result from the evolution of AI.\n\nTo this end, we need to implement flexible architecture designs equipped with mechanisms for expandability, interoperability, developing improved social order, and so on, both in the software and the  hardware  aspects  of  each  social  system.  Additionally,  we  need  to  establish  a  common  data\n\nutilization  infrastructure  for  various  social  systems,  in  particular  to  ensure  interoperability  and connectivity.\n\n## (3) Industrial Structures\n\nIn order for a diverse group of people to realize their assorted dreams and ideas, it is necessary for labor as well as employment and entrepreneur environments to be flexible and internationally open. For  this  reason,  companies  should  compete  fairly  and  promote  flexible  working  styles,  human creativity  should  continually  be  demonstrated  throughout  industries,  and  investment  in  startup businesses should be promoted.\n\n## (4) Innovation Systems (environments that support innovation)\n\nIt is necessary for universities, research institutions, industries, and the public at large to  participate  in  AI's  R&amp;D,  utilization  and  evaluation  across  fields  and  positions, stimulating each other, and creating an environment in which innovation can flourish.\n\nTo that end, all types of data including real space data should be instantaneously and securely available at a level that AI can analyze. Additionally, it is advisable to ensure privacy and security so that everyone can provide and distribute data with ease, and for there to be an environment where they can benefit from the data that they have provided.\n\nIt  is  advisable  to  accelerate  the  desired  development  of  AI  by  establishing  an environment in which those involved in R&amp;D, including users, can safely conduct R&amp;D and utilization of AI, and the cycle of R&amp;D and utilization can move rapidly. Preferably, the utilization of AI will create new ideas and possibilities, and significantly expand the potential of innovation.\n\n## (5) Governance\n\nIt is always necessary to continue to update the content and defined purposes discussed in the above-mentioned sections Human Potential, Social Systems, Industrial Structures, and Innovation Systems in line with social changes and technological developments.\n\nFor that reason, it is necessary to have a system that can be implemented and in place for various stakeholders, including government, industry, universities, research institutions,  and  the  general  public.  Then  they  will  be  able  to  work  together  on  such matters as identifying issues, evaluating impacts, and making decisions on regulatory governance including rules, systems, standardization and codes of conduct. Additionally, it is necessary to listen to people, including those who have a difficult time having their opinions  heard,  in  addition  the  various  stakeholders,  and  to  establish  a  system  that continuously addresses the most advanced social and technical issues.  When implementing such governance, flexible and effective measures should be taken not only in terms of the law but also by means of industries with appropriate technical means taking the initiative. In addition, international coordination for governance is important, and  in  addition  to  governance  in  each  individual  country,  an  international  system  of cooperation for dealing with cross-border problems should be established.\n\n## 4 Social Principles of Human-Centric AI\n\nWe recognize that in order to realize an \"AI-Ready Society\" and to promote an appropriate and proactive social implementation of AI, it is important to establish basic principles that each stakeholder should keep in mind.\n\nIn order for AI to be accepted and properly used by society, we will systemize these basic principles  into  \"Social  Principles  of  AI\"  to  which  society  (especially  state  legislative  and administrative bodies) should pay attention, and \"R&amp;D and Utilization Principles of AI\" to which developers and operators engaged in AI R&amp;D and social implementation should pay attention. The \"Social Principles of AI\" necessary for realizing a society with the three basic principles listed in Section 2, and the \"R&amp;D and Utilization Principles of AI\" that developers and business operators should consider, are as follows:\n\n## 4.1 Social Principles of AI\n\nSocial  Principles  of  AI  are  principles  relating  to  social  frameworks  that  should  be implemented across Japanese society including national and local governments as well as in multilateral frameworks in an \"AI-Ready Society.\"\n\n## (1) The Human-Centric Principle\n\nThe utilization of AI must not infringe upon the fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution and international standards.\n\nAI should be developed, utilized, and implemented in society to expand the abilities of people and allow diverse people to pursue their own well-being. In a society making use of AI, it is desirable that we introduce appropriate mechanisms for literacy education and for the promotion of proper use of AI so that people do not become over-dependent on AI or misuse AI to manipulate other people's decision-making.\n\n- \uf0d8 AI can expand human abilities and creativity not only by replacing aspects of human labor but also by assisting humans as a technologically advanced tool.\n- \uf0d8 When using AI, people must judge and decide for themselves how to use it. The appropriate stakeholders involved in the development, delivery and utilization of AI should be responsible for the consequences of AI utilization, depending on the nature of the problem.\n- \uf0d8 In the process of AI deployment, each stakeholder should take into consideration the user-friendliness of the system in order to allow all people to enjoy the benefits of  AI  and  avoid  creating  a  digital  divide  with  so-called  \"information  poor\"  or \"technology poor\" people left behind.\n\n## (2) The Principle of Education/Literacy\n\nIn a society premised on AI, we do not desire to create disparities or divisions between people or create those who are socially disadvantaged. Therefore, policy makers and managers  of  businesses  involved  in  AI  must  have  an  accurate  understanding  of  AI, knowledge and ethics permitting appropriate use of AI in society. They should take into account the complexity of AI and appreciate the possibility that AI could be intentional\n\nmisused.  AI  users  should  have  a  general  understanding  of  AI  and  should  acquire sufficient  education  to  use  it  properly,  given  that  AI  platforms  are  much  more complicated than already developed conventional tools. Regarding developers of AI, meanwhile, it is of course necessary for them to master the basics of AI technology. Additionally,  from  the  viewpoint  of  developing  AI  that  is  useful  to  society,  it  is important for developers to learn business models for how AI can be used in society, as well as to master a wide range of liberal arts such as social sciences and ethics including normative consciousness.\n\nFrom  this  point  of  view,  we  believe  that  an  educational  environment  that  fosters education and literacy in accordance with the following principles must be provided equally to all people.\n\n- \uf0d8 In  order  to  prevent  generating  disparities  between  people  or  to  create  socially vulnerable individuals, opportunities for education in a wide range of literacy skills are  to  be  provided  in  early  childhood  education  and  primary  and  secondary education. Opportunities are also to be provided for the reeducation of  working adults and the elderly.\n- \uf0d8 With regard to literacy education and skills required to use AI, our society needs an educational system that allows anyone to acquire the basics of AI, mathematics, and data  science.  All  people  need  to  learn  beyond  the  boundaries  of  literature  and science. It is also necessary to prepare content in literacy education on the limits of security and AI technology in order to raise awareness of AI and data characteristics. These characteristics include bias in data, the possibility of causing bias depending on how AI is used, and issues of fairness, impartiality, and privacy protection that are inherently needed in the use of AI.\n- \uf0d8 In  a  society  where  AI  is  pervasive,  it  is  to  be  expected  that  the  educational environment will change from the current unilateral and uniform teaching style to one that makes use of individual interests and skill sets. For that reason, society as a whole shares a sense that the education system is always changing flexibly to the optimal  form  of  teaching  regardless  of  previous  successful  experiences  in  the educational environment to date.  In education, it is desirable to have an interactive educational environment for the prevention of dropouts and an environment that fully utilizes AI technologies to allow students to work together.\n- \uf0d8 It is desirable not to impose an unnecessary burden only on the administration or schools (teachers), but to work independently with private enterprises and citizens toward the development of such an educational environment.\n\n## (3) The Principle of Privacy Protection\n\nNot all AI technologies increase the risk associated with the use of personal data, but in a society premised on AI, it is still possible to gauge each person's political position, economic  situation,  personal  hobbies,  personal  preferences,  and  so  forth  with  great accuracy based on data about matters such as data subject's individual behavior. This means, when utilizing AI, that more careful discretion may be required than the mere handling of personal data in accordance with the level of importance and sensitivity of the data. Each stakeholder must handle personal data based on the following principles to ensure that no individuals are disadvantaged from the unexpected distribution or use\n\nof personal data in undesirable ways.\n\n- \uf0d8 We should make sure that any AI using personal data and any service solutions that use AI, including use by the government, do not infringe on a person's individual freedom, dignity or equality.\n- \uf0d8 If the use of AI threatens to increase the possibility of harming individuals, technical mechanisms and non-technical frameworks should be developed to reduce the risk. In particular, AI using personal data should have mechanisms to ensure accuracy and legitimacy, and to allow individuals to be substantially involved in managing the privacy of their personal data. This would make it possible for people to provide personal data with peace of mind when using AI, and effectively benefit from the data they provide.\n- \uf0d8 Personal data must be protected appropriately according to its degree of importance and  sensitivity.  Personal  data  contains  a  variety  of  information,  ranging  from matters that are highly likely to have a great influence on an individual's rights and interests  (these  would  typically  be  personal  thoughts,  beliefs,  medical  history, criminal records, and so on), to matters that are semi-public in nature in a person's social  life.  Keeping  this  in  mind,  we  need  to  pay  close  attention  to  the  balance between the use of, and need for protection of, personal data based on the cultural background and common understanding of society.\n\n## (4) The Principle of Ensuring Security\n\nThe active use of AI automates many social systems and greatly improves safety. On the other hand, at least within the scope of currently available technologies, it is not always possible  for  AI  to  respond  appropriately  to  rare  events  or  deliberate  attacks. Therefore, the use of AI poses a new set of risks to security. Society should always be aware of the balance between the benefits and risks, and endeavor to improve social safety and sustainability as a whole.\n\n- \uf0d8 Society must promote broad, deep research and development related to AI (from immediate measures to deep essential understanding), such as the proper assessment of risks in the utilization of AI and research to reduce risks. Society must make firm efforts to conduct risk management including the safeguard of cybersecurity.\n- \uf0d8 Society should always pay attention to sustainability in the use of AI Society, in particular, must not be uniquely dependent on just one type of AI or a few specific types of AI.\n\n## (5) The Principle of Fair Competition\n\nA fair competitive environment must be maintained in order to create new businesses and services, to maintain sustainable economic growth, and to present solutions to social challenges.\n\n- \uf0d8 Even if resources related to AI are concentrated in a specific country, we must not have a society where unfair data collection and  infringement of sovereignty are performed under that country's dominant position.\n- \uf0d8 Even if resources related to AI are concentrated into specific companies, we must\n\nnot have a society where unfair data collection and unfair competition take place using their dominant position.\n\n- \uf0d8 The use of AI should not generate a situation where wealth and social influence are unfairly biased towards certain stakeholders.\n- (6) The Principle of Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency\n\nIn  an  \"AI-Ready  Society\",  it  is  necessary  to  ensure  fairness  and  transparency  in decision-making, appropriate accountability for the results, and trust in the technology, so that people who use AI are not subject to undue discrimination with regard to personal background, or to unfair treatment in terms of human dignity.\n\n- \uf0d8 Under  AI's  design  concept,  all  people  are  treated  fairly  without  unjustified discrimination  on  the  grounds  of  diverse  backgrounds  such  as  race,  gender, nationality, age, political beliefs, religion, and so on.\n- \uf0d8 Appropriate explanations should be given on a case-by-case basis depending on the application of AI and each particular situation, including such things as when AI is being used, how the AI data is obtained and used, and what measures have been taken to ensure the appropriateness of results obtained from AI operations.\n- \uf0d8 In order for people to understand AI's proposals and make judgments on them, there should be appropriate opportunities for an open dialogue, as required, regarding the use, adoption, and operation of AI.\n- \uf0d8 Taking into account the above viewpoints and in order to use AI safely in society, a  mechanism  must  be  established  to  ensure  trust  in  AI,  and  in  the  data  and algorithms that support it.\n- (7) The Principle of Innovation\n- \uf0d8 To realize Society 5.0 and aim for continuous innovation that advances as people evolve  together  with  AI  development,  we  should  transcend  boundaries  such  as national borders, industries, academia, governments, race, gender, nationality, age, political convictions and religion. We should promote total globalization, diversification,  and  industry-academia-government  cooperation  in  both  human resources and research, based on a wide range of knowledge, perspectives, ideas, and so on.\n- \uf0d8 We must promote equal collaboration among universities, research institutions and companies, and the flexible movement of human resources.\n- \uf0d8 To implement AI efficiently and safely in society, methods for confirming the quality and reliability of AI, and for efficient collection and maintenance of data used by AI must be promoted. In addition to establishing AI engineering such as methods for the development, testing and operation of AI, it is necessary to promote the establishment and development of a wide range of studies such as ethical and economic aspects of AI.\n- \uf0d8 To  ensure  the  sound  development  of  AI  technology,  while  securing  privacy  and\n\nsecurity, it is necessary to establish a platform environment where data from all fields can be  effectively  utilized  across  national  borders  without  being  monopolized.  In addition, to promote research on AI, R&amp;D environments should be established where computer resources and high-speed networks that promote international collaboration and accelerate AI are shared and used.\n\n- \uf0d8 The government must proceed with regulatory reforms to reduce impeding factors in all related fields in order to establish an efficient and beneficial society with the aid of AI technologies.\n\n## 4.2 AI R&amp;D and Utilization Principles\n\nWe believe that developers and business operators of AI should establish and comply with the AI development and utilization principles based on the fundamental philosophy and social principles of AI outlined above.\n\nSince many countries, organizations, companies, and so on are currently discussing AI development and utilization principles, we believe it is important to create an international consensus  quickly  through  open  discussions,  and  share  results  internationally  in  a  nonregulatory, non-binding framework.\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nIn order to lead the world in building the first \"AI-Ready Society,\" Japan should share the principles herein with the government, related industries, organizations, and so on, and reflect them in government policies.\n\nIn addition, Japan should share these principles with other countries around the world and take a leadership role in international discussions with the goal of establishing an AI-Ready Society worldwide. In doing so, Japan should present to the world a social image of Society 5.0 that supports the realization of the SDGs, and should contribute to cooperative and creative new development of the international community.\n\nThese principles should be flexibly revised in the future according to the progress of AIrelated technologies, social changes, changes in the world situation, and many other factors.\n\n## Establishment of the \"Council for Social Principles of Human-centric AI\"\n\nFebruary 15, 2019\n\nAI Strategy Expert Meeting for Strength and Promotion of the Innovation Decision\n\n- 1.  The  \"Council  for  Social  Principles  of  Human-centric  AI\"  (hereinafter  the  \"Council\")  is established,  under  the  AI  Strategy  Expert  Meeting  for  Strength  and  Promotion  of  the Innovation, for the purpose of examining the basic principles for implementing and sharing AI in a better way and reflecting it in AI strategy.

This report was created after discussions including interviews with total of 15 researchers, business operators, etc. and public comments.\n\n## Background\n\n- While AI has the potential to greatly contribute to Japan's development, various risks are becoming apparent.\n- There are many concerns over AI, pointing out that its developmentand use are not progressing compared to other countries.\n- It is necessary to ensure appropriateness such as the transparency of AI, and advance development and use of AI.\n\n## Basic Concept\n\n## Promotion of innovation while mitigating risks\n\n(I.3.)\n\n- Promoting innovation including support to research and development, human resources development and expansion of data or computing resources\n- Appropriate combination with laws and guidelines\n- Leading discussion toward formulation of AI governance\n- Use of the common principles   such as the OECD AI principles and Hiroshima Process International   Guiding Principles for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems and individual existing laws\n- International cooperation (I.4.)\n- Ensuring international consistency and interoperability\n\nTrustworthy AI\n\n## Specific Directions for Systems and Policies\n\n- Overall items (I.1) Aiming to be 'the friendliest country in the world for developing and implementing Al\"\n- Strengthening the government's function of a strategic leadership board and formulating AI strategy\n\nPrompt legislation is necessary\n\nA system aiming to be a global model\n\n- Strengthening function of AI strategic leadership_board to oversee the whole picture Formulating AI strategy (AI basic plan)to contribute to promoting safe and secure research and development, and use of AI.\n- Improving AI safety\n- Process) and cooperation by business operators\n- Conducting surveys and collecting information by the government, and guidancer advice and information provision; etc to business operators and citizens\n- Use of AI by the Government (m.2.)\n- Use in infrastructure services (I.3.)\n- Appropriate AI government procurement and use, etc.\n- Response by each business act, etc.\n- 1) \"AI Strategic Council' was established under \"the Integrated Innovation Strategy Promotion Council\" which is chaired by the Chief Cabinet Secretary and consists of all cabinet ministers. AI Institutional Study Group' was established under the Council.\n- 2) future risks.\n\n## I.Preface\n\nSince autumn 2022, generative AI has experienced a dramatic leap in performance, enabling it to produce  natural  conversations,  write  code,  and  create  sophisticated  videos  by  processing  vast amounts of information. This advanced AI has the potential to replace tasks traditionally performed by humans and even produce outcomes that surpass human achievements. It is anticipated to find applications across all fields of human activity, significantly enhancing efficiency and convenience in various industries and everyday life and to become a role to supplement new science discovery and humans' creativity. In the future, it is expected to contribute significantly to improving quality of life and driving national economic development.\n\nOn the other hand, various risks with AI are becoming apparent, including sophisticated criminal behavior  such  as  fake  websites  and  voice  scams,  and  information  manipulation  by  using  and spreading AI  to  create  disinformation  and  misinformation.  There  are  also  concerns  over  national security risks by using AI in the development of CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons) and cyberattacks as AI has an aspect of dual-use technology.\n\nUnder such circumstances, in the EU, the AI Act, a comprehensive regulation on AI, came into effect in August 2024. The AI Act adopts an approach in response to four levels of risks. It has introduced regulations  prohibiting AI  that  threatens  human's  safety  and  fundamental  rights  from  putting  into markets  or  using,  and  imposing  an  obligation  to  conduct  impact  assessments  and  conformity assessments before putting a high-risk AI, which is likely to seriously harm the health and safety of humanity and democracy and the rule of law, into the market. In addition, the Act has established regulations imposing obligations of the transparency including creation of technological documents and disclosure of training data on providers of the general-purpose AI, and additionally imposing an implementation  of  model  evaluation  or  a  report  obligation  regarding  incidents  on  providers  of  a general-purpose AI with systemic risks, such as those having computational volumes of training that is more than 10 25  FLOPs.\n\nIn  the  United  States,  since  July  2023,  major  AI  development  companies  have  announced  a voluntary commitment to implement information sharing regarding risk management of AI, research regarding social risks possibly caused by AI system and investment in cyber security. Additionally, in October 2023, to mitigate national security risks, based on the Defense Production Act, an Executive Order was issued, instructing US companies who develop dual-use foundation models with which computational  volumes  of  training  are  over  10 26 FLOPs,  to  continuously  submit  information  on activities related to models' training, development or manufacture to the government, but the order was revoked on January 20, 2025. Three days later, on January 23, a new executive order related to AI was announced, indicating a review of policies and regulations, which are formulated under the previous order, and to conduct an action plan. Additionally, in September 2024, State of California enacted the state law SB 942 to improve the transparency of contents generated by AI and the state\n\nlaw AB 2013 to disclose the data used for training AI.\n\nThe  G7  in  2023,  which  was  under  Japan's  presidency,  launched  \"Hiroshima AI  Process 1 \"  to consider  global  rules  related  to  generative AI,  and  established  \"Hiroshima  Process  International Guiding  Principles  for  All  AI  Actors\"  and  \"Hiroshima  Process  International  Code  of  Conduct  for Organizations  Developing Advanced AI  Systems\"  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  \"Hiroshima  Process International Guiding  Principles, etc.\") aimed  at  realizing safe, secure, and  trustworthy  AI. Subsequently, Japan, as an outreach beyond the G7, launched the Hiroshima AI Process Friends Group,  working  on  expanding  the  number  of  countries  and  regions  that  support  the  spirit  of  the Hiroshima AI Process. In 2024, Italy, as presidency of the G7, took over the Hiroshima AI Process, and discussions on a framework to monitor implementation of the international code of conduct have been taking  place.  In  addition  to  these,  there  have  been  active  discussions  on AI  governance  in frameworks among multilateral countries including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, and the OECD.\n\nIn Japan, since May 2023, \"TENTATIVE SUMMARY OF AI ISSUES\" (AI Strategic Council, May 26, 2023) and \"General Understanding on AI legal system\" (AI Strategic Team, May 2024) have been completed, summarizing discussion points on AI and indicating general understanding on AI legal system, and \"The Integrated Innovation Strategy 2024\" (decision by the Cabinet, on June 4, 2024) establishes strategy aimed at strengthening competition in the field of AI and ensuring safety and security.  Furthermore,  \"AI  Guidelines  for  Business  Ver  1.01\"  (Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  and Communications, and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry on November 22, 2024) indicates an approach  to  develop,  provide,  and  use  AI  in  business  activities,  and  for  relevant  ministries  to cooperate in forming AI policies.\n\nAccording to the result of a survey on awareness for AI risks and safety (Figure 1) in Japan, as low as 13% of respondents think that 'they can use AI safely under current rules and laws,' and 77% of them think that 'AI  needs  to  be  regulated.'  Furthermore, they  feel  risky  about  'quality  instability,' 'process black-boxing' and so on, and they also call on the government to 'strengthen legal measures against  misuse  of AI  or  crimes  using AI.'  In  terms  of  dealing  with  risks  of AI,  while  in  countries, especially  European  countries  and  the  U.S.,  discussions  and  considerations  of  the  legal  system related to AI are progressing, Japan has responded mainly by pursuing 'soft laws' such as guidelines, and has not yet considered a legal system specifically for AI.\n\nBased  on  the  above  situation,  the AI  Institutional  Study  Group  was  established  under  the AI Strategic Council. It holds interviews with various stakeholders including business operators, experts\n\n1 Based on the result of the G7 Hiroshima Summit held in May 2023, this process was established in May 2023 to discuss generative AI, whose rapid development and expansion have become significant issues for the international community as a whole.\n\nand local governments, and is considering how the AI legal system should be, including whether it is necessary  or  not.  This  consideration  was  based  on  the  spirit  of  the  Hiroshima AI  process,  and discussions  were  held  based  on  four  basic  principles:  'Balance  between  risk  mitigation  and  the promotion  of  innovation,'  'Design  of  flexible  legal  systems  that  can  respond  to  the  speed  of technological and business change,' 'International interoperability,' and 'Proper procurement and use of AI by the government.' This report summarizes the result of considerations based on the interviews and  discussions  by  the  AI  Institutional  Study  Group.  Relevant  ministries  considered  to  interpret intellectual property laws, including copyright, in the process of development and use of AI. As for the use of AI from the perspective of national security, ministries and agencies related to the field are leading progressive discussions on considering AI specifically.\n\n## Survey on Awareness for AI Risks and Safety (International Comparison)\n\n- Compared to the United States, in Japan, more companies are concerned about \"quality instability;\" process black-boxing; and \"fake contents; and fewer companies take governance against AI risks\n- In Japan, only 139 of respondents think that can use AI safely under current rules laws; the lowest among the surveyed countries, and 779 of them think that AI needs to be regulated; ahead of the United States, France and Germany.

Specialized AI is one that is specialized in processing specific tasks such as voice recognition, image recognition, or autonomous driving. General-purpose AI is one that is trained on larger amount of data than specialized AI, has high versatility and can process various tasks.  Generative AI 2 ,  whose potential  has  attracted  a  great  deal  of  attention  in  recent  years, generally belongs to general-purpose AI. It had been considered that general-purpose AI generally improve its performance as the number of parameters of training data and models increases, but, recently, general-purpose AI with high performance regardless of scales of training data has also appeared. Some people say that in the future, AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), which will have an ability to realize various tasks at the same level as humans, will appear. As described above, AI technology has been making remarkable progress in recent years. The definitions of terms related to  AI,  including  'AI'  and  'business  operators,'  have  been  discussed  internationally,  and  it  is considered that these definitions will continue to change from now on, so it is also important to take these discussions into consideration.\n\n## \uff12 .Related actors\n\n## \uff08\uff11\uff09 Main actors\n\nIn  this  report,  in  the  lifecycle  from  data  collection  or  model  development  to  AI  system development, (including AI models), and finally use of AI services, we will describe on the premise of three main actors; AI developer, AI provider and AI user. (Figure 2)\n\nFirst, AI developers shall be those who collect data, train models, and develop constructions of models' system infrastructure or input/output functions. Second, AI providers shall be those who incorporate AI into existing or new systems, and provide the AI systems so that it is ready for use in services, or those who implement everything from incorporating AI to providing AI service. Finally, AI users shall be those who incorporate AI systems implemented by others into their own services to use them as AI services, or those who use the provided AI services.\n\nFurthermore, in addition to the three main stakeholders listed above, it is also necessary to be aware of the existence of various other stakeholders: those who provide training data, those who provide necessary resources for AI such as data centers, and those who conduct research.\n\n2 It is defined 'a general term representing AI developed from an AI model that can generate texts, images, programs, etc.' in 'AI Guidelines for Business Ver1.01'\n\nFigure 2 Positioning of each actor\n\n## \uff08\uff12\uff09 Overseas actors\n\nMuch of the generative AI used in Japan is provided by overseas business operators; it is not appropriate to exclude overseas business operators uniformly from the subject in considering AIrelated legal systems. Given that people living in Japan can easily access and use AI services which overseas business operators provide via the Internet, on a daily basis, and that domestic business operators may suffer unilateral disadvantages if legal systems which impose business operators any obligation exclude only overseas business operators, overseas business operators should also be covered by the legal system same as domestic business operators. In this case, to ensure the effectiveness of the legal system even for overseas business operators from whom it is difficult to obtain compliance cooperation due to geographical factors, etc., consideration should be given to formulating rules that clearly include overseas business operators as well. In practice, if an overseas business operator has a branch office or representative in Japan, it may be possible to consider requesting responses through them.\n\n## \uff13 .  Promotion of innovation while mitigating risks\n\nWhile AI can cause various risks depending on the methods of its development or use, etc., it also has the potential to greatly contribute to improving people's lives and developing the national economy. It is important to promote innovation while mitigating risks to make Japan the friendliest country in the world for developing and implementing AI.\n\n## \uff08\uff11\uff09 Promoting innovation\n\n## \u2460 Support for research and development\n\nResearch and development of AI require large amounts of training data, as well as facilities and equipment that can handle large-scale information processing, information communications, data storage, etc. From the perspective of aiming to promote innovation by various stakeholders\n\n(including  startup  companies)  using  these  facilities  and  equipment,  it  is  important  that  the government makes progress in  the  promotion.  In  addition,  with  regard  to  human  resources researching and developing, since the shortage of AI talent in Japan is becoming more serious due to the intensifying global competition for talent, it is important to actively promote human resource development.\n\nThe  government  and  other  relevant  stakeholders  are  already  working  on  organizing  and expanding high-quality Japanese language data, etc. and providing it appropriately to Japanese companies. They are also working on promoting the establishment of data centers, securing power supplies, and supporting AI semiconductors. Human resource development projects such as' Next Generation AI Human Resources Development Program 3 ' have been implemented. Support for research and development of AI should continue to be carried out from various aspects.\n\nIn addition to these, as seen in the development of generative AI and rapid expansion of its usage  following  breakthroughs  in  basic  research  and  development  related  to  large-scale language models, there is a close relationship between basic research of AI and its broader application. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the promotion of basic research.\n\nAt present, RIKEN is a National Research and Development Agency working on AI for Science, which involves using AI foundation models in scientific research, and this has the potential to bring about major changes in scientific research methods and research itself. Further, in April 2024, Japan-U.S. Joint Leaders' Statement involved collaboration between Argonne National Laboratory, U.S. and AI for Science, and international collaboration has also been carried out. It is important to continue to engage in such research and development activities that contribute to the development of other fields.\n\n## \u2461 Use by business operators\n\nTo improve the competitiveness of Japan, it is important to widely implement AI technology in society and ensure its utilization by domestic business operators as well as to support research and development as referred to in \u2460 . For example, promoting initiatives that transfer and apply research results from government research institutions, universities, etc. to society can lead to new business stakeholders by business operators and revitalization of various industries.\n\nIn Japan, it is common for business operators to develop their own AI systems and provide AI services for consumers. As it can be considered that the number of business operators that\n\n3 'Broadening  Opportunities  for  Outstanding  Young  Researchers  and  Doctoral  Students  in  Strategic Areas; Next Generation AI Human Resources Development Program' is a program run by the Japan Science and Technology Agency that provides support to young researchers and doctoral students who are working on research and development in the field of next-generation AI: AI fields and emerging and integrating domains in the AI fields.\n\nprovide AI  services  for  consumers  by  using AI  systems  developed  by  other companies 4 will much increase in the future, it is also important for the government to create an environment that  allows  such  business  operators  to  smoothly  provide AI  services  both  domestically  and internationally. Specifically, to promote highly secure AI systems to expand their market, it is effective to ensure international consistency and implement safety evaluations and certifications, etc.  as  mentioned  later.  For  example,  by  providing  incentives  for  those  who  have  obtained certification and increasing the number of the certified business operators, it is considered that many citizens will be able to use AI more securely, the market will expand, and innovation will be promoted. Furthermore, to encourage domestic business operators to participate newly in the AI market, it is also important to create an environment where business operators can learn the basic knowledge, etc. of AI.\n\nIn addition, we should also focus on use of AI in robotics, medicines and disaster prevention, and international collaboration and contribution such as collaboration with Asian countries.\n\n## \uff08\uff12\uff09 Application of laws and making use of soft law\n\nMain laws and regulations related to examples of risks that AI can pose, are as shown in Figure 3. There are some real cases occurred in Japan: the face of a performer who was in a sexual video content was replaced to that of the different entertainer and was disclosed in the Internet (violation of defamation in the Penal Code, and of the Copyright Act), computer virus was created by utilizing generative AI (the Crimes Related to Electronic or Magnetic Records Containing Unauthorized Commands in the Penal Code), and a woman character created by utilizing generative AI was misused to perpetrate money fraud (the Crimes of Fraud in the Penal Code). On the premise of the fact that such risks have already been mitigated to some extent by existing laws, it is necessary to consider further about legal systems.\n\nIn mitigating risks, there are responses by laws and by soft law such as guidelines.\n\nCurrently In Japan, to deal with risks and problems caused by AI, the government ministries and agencies responsible for each field are responding through laws and soft laws. For example, in June 2023, while indicating points of caution related to handling personal information when using generative  AI  services,  the  Personal  Information  Protection  Commission  alerted  personal information handling business operators and  administrative  bodies 5 to handle personal\n\n4 Benesse  Corporation  is  using  AI  systems  developed  by  other  companies  to  provide  services  for customers, such as 'AI to help with Independent Research' and services that use accumulated knowledge and data (as referred to Material 2 at the 2nd meeting of the AI Institutional Study Group).\n\n5 This  refers  to  administrative  bodies,  local  governments'  bodies  (except  councils),  incorporated administrative agencies (except agencies listed in Appended Table 2, the Act on the Protection of Personal Information) and local independent administrative agencies (except institutions whose main purpose is the\n\ninformation properly, in accordance with the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (Act No.57, 2003). Further, in March 2024, the Legal Subcommittee under the Copyright Subdivision of the Cultural Council, Agency for Cultural Affairs, presented a certain way of thinking related to the  interpretation  of  the  relationship  between  AI  and  the  current  Copyright  Act  in  mitigating concerns about potential copyright infringement when generative AI learns from a great amount of data and generates contents. Additionally, in May 2024, the Intellectual Property Study Group, the Cabinet  Office,  summarized  the  thoughts  on  legal  rules  on  the  relationship  between AI  and intellectual property rights, while indicating the thoughts on the necessity that each actor works on through a combination of legal, technical, and contractual measures to realize an ecosystem where the advancement of AI technology and the appropriate protection of intellectual property rights can coexist. Furthermore, as mentioned at the beginning of this report, in April 2024, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry published the 'AI Guidelines for Business Ver1.0' 6 , which states that AI systems and services should be developed, provided, and used respecting the rule of law, human rights, democracy, diversity, and a fair and just society.\n\nIf there is any penalty provided in laws, public organizations can invoke some kind of coercive power, which means an advantage that it is easy to ensure effectiveness of the rules, but, it may hinder the development of the regulated field, and there is also the drawback that it lacks flexibility, as it takes a certain amount of time to consider their scope by the fact that the regulations which affect the rights and interests of citizens need to be clear. Even laws that do not involve penalty can discipline domestic and overseas business operators and thereby ensure a certain level of effectiveness by clearly stating their obligations and responsibilities in the laws.\n\nOn the other hand, soft laws such as guidelines has the advantage of being able to respond quickly and flexibly in line with the international situations and the latest technological trends, and having less negative impact on innovation, while the soft law might have to rely on the voluntary response of business operators.\n\nIn general, Japanese companies are known for their high consciousness of legal compliance, and when new regulations are established, there is a possibility that they may hesitate more than necessary  in  conducting  new  research  and  development  or  in  developing  and  deploying  new services due to their focus on adhering to these regulations. In the field of AI, where technological development  and  service  changes  are  rapid,  excessive  regulations  that  inhibit  research  and development, or development and deployment of services carry the risk of undermining Japan's international competitiveness in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to fully consider the impact on innovation when considering and introducing new legal systems.\n\nbusiness listed  in Article  21,  item  1  of  the  Local  Independent Administrative Agencies  Law,  or  whose purpose is the business listed in the same Article, item 2 or 3(h) ).\n\n6 In November 2024, the version 1.01 was released with updates.\n\nFrom what is mentioned above, it is essential to appropriately combine laws and soft laws such as guidelines to ensure the promotion of innovation while mitigating risks. Basically, the autonomy of business operators should be respected, and regulations by laws should be limited to cases where voluntary efforts by business operators cannot be expected.\n\nFurthermore, in domains where individual laws and regulations already exist, AI is beginning to be used for various purposes in each domain, and the circumstances where rights and interests need to be protected vary depending on the application of AI, so it is essential to first address these issues by making use of the framework of the relevant laws and regulations. In addition, if implementing legal regulations including the cases of creating new legal systems outside of such domains  mentioned  above,  while  taking  into  account  the  impact  on  the  activities  of  business operators and the risks posed by AI, as mentioned in (3) below, the extent of application should be at the level which protects the rights and interests that truly need to be protected. In doing so, it is important to be aware of the division of roles between the government and business operators, and to clearly draw a line between what is subject to regulations and to what extent business activities are permitted. It is also important to consider based on the principle of technological neutrality in regulations, which means that regulations should not mandate or prioritize the use of specific types of technology in order to achieve their objectives. Applying regulations to cases where inappropriate AI is prototyped for legitimate research related to AI safety, etc., needs to be considered including its necessity. When considering legal systems that broadly target business operators in general, it is  necessary to ensure that the systems are manageable for business operators of any scale, including startup companies, by considering the burden on business operators associated with compliance.\n\n| AI can posec   | Specific examples and hypothetical cases                                                                                                                                                                                                | Main laws, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                | Entering confidential corporate information into an external AI service, ending up with information leakage                                                                                                                             | The Unfair Competition Prevention Act, The Civil Code (contract) XFebruary 2024, the points of notes when using AI were summarized in \"The Handbook to protect confidential information\" (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry)                                                                                        |\n|                | Training for the purpose of generating images similar to illustrations of specific manga anime characters, etc., and generating and using such images similar to those illustrations                                                    | The Copyright Act xMarch 2024, \"General Understanding on AI and Copyright in Japan\" was published, clearing the interpretation   (Agency for Cultural Affairs)                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                | By training the registered trademarks of others, creating trademarks that are identical or similar to the registered trademarks, and using them for goods or services that are identical or similar to the designated goods or services | The Design Act, The Trademark Act X 2024, \"Intellectual Property Right Study Group in the AI era Interim Report\" was published, organizing the approach to legal rules.

Based on these, as a domestic norm, \"AI Guidelines for Business\" for all those involved in the development, provision and use of AI across various business activities, was published, and what should broadly and generally be complied with has been formulated. In order to mitigate risks more appropriately as well as to ensure the promotion of innovation, while updating the content of the 'AI Guidelines for Business' in line with technological developments, etc.,  it  is  important  to  deal  with  as  necessary  as  well  as  to  promote  dissemination  and enlightenment, etc. so that each entity complies appropriately. To appropriately mitigate risks, in addition to clarifying the roles of each entity such as developers and providers in accordance with the guidelines, it is necessary to clarify responsibilities. At the same time, it is necessary to share vital  information  and  closely  collaborate  among  respective  stakeholders  such  as  between developers and providers, and between providers and users.\n\nWhen using AI in a specific domain, it is important to consider the purpose, method of use, etc., and to respond individually. For example, AI related to infrastructure and services that form the  basis  of  people's  lives  and  economic  activities  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  'infrastructure services, etc.'), and product safety is addressed primarily through existing laws by the respective ministries and agencies.\n\nIn addition, due to the rapid development of AI, it is also necessary to appropriately mitigate newly emerging risks depending on the content of respective fields. In particular, as for AI that actually  poses  or  is  highly  likely  to  pose  a  serious  threat  to  fundamental  human  rights  and interests such as life, body, and property, as well as to social safety and national security, the necessity of regulation should be considered depending on the contents of the risks and the severity of their social impacts.\n\nTo achieve this, collaborating between the government and business operators, based on the actual cases, with various AI models and uses in existence, at each stage of the AI lifecycle, such as  development,  provision,  and  use,  it  is  necessary  to  analyze  the  factors  of  potential  risks, including the types of AI models, the nature of risks they pose, and the impact they may have on different stakeholders. As a prerequisite, it is important to survey and analyze the current state of AI development and use, and then to take necessary measures timely and appropriately after sharing this awareness throughout society. For example, there are concerns about inappropriate AI screening job applicants and AI confusing consumers, and the government should strive to consider necessary measures including technical responses while working on comprehending the actual situation. Further, when requesting cooperation from each entity for the government's understanding of the actual situation, the government should adhere to the basic principles such\n\nas the rule of law, due process, democratic and responsible administrative, and fundamental human rights, especially the right of privacy etc., as confirmed in the Hiroshima AI Process and so on, and it is necessary to prevent the government from arbitrarily exercising its authority and reducing predictability or causing a shrinkage effect on business operators.\n\nOther countries have established regulations based on the scale of AI including the amount of calculation of training, or the number of users, but in light of the development of high-performance AI that is not dependent on its scale, it is necessary to consider what factors should be taken into account.\n\n## \uff14 .  Promoting international cooperation\n\n## \uff08\uff11\uff09 Formation of AI governance\n\nWith  regard  to  AI  governance,  there  are  lively  discussions  in  framework  of  multilateral countries.\n\nAs mentioned in '1. Preface,' following the G7 Hiroshima Summit in May 2023, G7 established the 'Hiroshima AI Process' to consider international rules regarding generative AI. In December of the same year, the \"Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework\", which includes the  'Hiroshima  Process  International  Guiding  Principles  for All AI Actors'  and  the  'Hiroshima Process International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems', was approved by the G7 leaders. After that, Japan has been sharing the spirit of the Hiroshima AI Process  at  various  international  conferences,  etc.,  aiming  at  realizing  safe,  secure,  and trustworthy AI. And as an outreach beyond G7, in May 2024, with the support of 49 countries and regions that agree with the spirit of the initiative, the 'Hiroshima AI Process Friends Group' was established,  aiming  to  expand  support.  As  the  international  formation  of AI  governance  will determine  the  direction  of  future AI  development  and  contribute  to  national  interests,  Japan should continue to lead the discussion at various international conferences based on the concept of Hiroshima AI Process. In addition, Japan should establish an AI legal system that serves as a model for other countries and disseminate it to the world.\n\nIn September 2024, the 'Global Digital Compact' was adopted as an annex to the outcome document of the Summit of the Future at the United Nations. It included the establishment of an international scientific panel on AI to promote scientific understanding through the assessment of AI  risks  and  opportunities,  as  well  as  the  launch  of  a  global  dialogue  on AI  governance  that national governments and related stakeholders participate. Additionally, the Council of Europe has established the 'The Council of Europe Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights,  Democracy  and  the  Rule  of  Law'  and,  at  present,  in  addition  to  the  EU,  10 countries including the United States and the United Kingdom have signed the convention. The OECD  established  AI  principle  in  2019,  which  consists  of  inclusive  growth,  sustainable development and well-being, human-centered values and fairness, etc., and has just updated it\n\nin May 2024 to mitigate risks of disinformation and misinformation by generative AI developing rapidly. The  Global  Partnership  on Artificial  Intelligence  (GPAI),  which  is  an  international  and multistakeholder initiative  to  realize  the  development  and  use  of  'responsible AI'  based  on  a human-centered approach, in November 2022 held the GPAI Summit 2022 in Tokyo and reached an agreement of the first Ministerial Declaration among respective countries on the promotion of the use of AI based on human-centered values, opposition against the illegal and irresponsible use of AI, and contributions to sustainable, resilient, and peaceful societies, etc., whose result was announced as the first ministerial declaration. After making an integrated partnership with the OECD in July 2024, GPAI members have reached 44, and the first GPAI Expert Support Center  in Asia  was  established  in  Tokyo  to  support  projects  regarding  safety  evaluation  of generative AI promoted by the Hiroshima AI Process. Furthermore, various discussions are taking place internationally, and in terms of implementing legal systems and policies related to AI, we should  respond  based  on  agreements  or  acceptable  arrangements  and  concepts  in  these international frameworks, etc.\n\n## \uff08\uff12\uff09 Ensuring international consistency and interoperability\n\nAs mentioned earlier, citizens can use AI services provided by business operators in various countries through the Internet, and AI services in Japan can be used by people from all over the world. In this situation, if the interoperability between international norms regarding safety, etc. that must  be  satisfied  and  norms  applied  in  Japan  is  ensured,  business  operators  in  Japan  can smoothly advance into overseas markets, and citizens are able to access AI services all over the world, so it is important to ensure international consistency and interoperability.\n\nTherefore, in addition to the importance of the Hiroshima AI Process, standardization activities that  set  international  standards  in  ISO,  IEC,  etc.  are  significant  for  the  development  of  global markets and business activities in the future, and it is necessary to discuss among a wide range of stakeholders, have a long-term perspective and promote actively.\n\nThe AI Safety Institute (AISI), an organization that examines and promotes evaluation methods and standards for AI safety, is working as a hub for AI safety knowledge in domestic and overseas on  building  a  network  with  related  domestic  and  overseas  organization,  as  well  as  creating guidance for safety evaluation, etc. Following the AI Safety Summit held in the UK in November 2023,  discussions  on  governance  from  a  technical  perspective  regarding  the  safety  of  AI progressed, and in February 2024, the AISI was established in Japan following the UK and the US, and to ensure the international consistency and interoperability mentioned above, it is important to promote initiatives by the AISI.\n\n## III.  Direction of specific legal systems and policies\n\n## \uff11 .  Overall items\n\nAI, including generative AI, is highly versatile and is used in various fields, and there are different ways to mitigate risks. With regard to mitigating risks including handling of personal information or copyright and dealing with disinformation and misinformation, it is on the premise of responding mainly through  existing  laws,  etc..  In  terms  of AI,  however,  there  are  also  cases  where  a  cross-cutting response  is  required,  so  it  is  necessary  to  strengthen  the  government's  function  of  a  strategic leadership  board  which  oversees  the  whole  picture,  to  formulate  strategies,  and  to  ensure  the transparency and appropriateness to improve safety, and, as necessary, it is appropriate to develop legal systems.\n\n## \uff08\uff11\uff09 Strengthening the government's function of a strategic leadership board and formulating strategy\n\nDue to the expansion of fields of application and uses, the emergence of general-purpose AI, etc.,  there  are  cases  where  the  period  from  research  and  development  to  use  is  short,  and initiatives at each stage during this period can be carried out almost simultaneously. For this reason, the initiatives in various stakeholders and processes from research and development to use are closely relating each other, so it is necessary to carry them out in integrated and cross-cutting manner, and the government's function of a strategic leadership board should be strengthened to promote integrated measures from research and development to use in economical society.\n\nIn addition to the case of using AI to improve people' lives in various situations including by the national government and local governments, there are also concerns over its misuse for criminal purposes, and it also has an aspect of dual-use technology. So, in terms of strengthening the function of a strategic leadership board, it is necessary to establish a system of policy promotion in which the relevant government ministries and agencies participate widely.\n\nFurthermore, to promote comprehensive measures, it is necessary for the strategic leadership board to formulate a strategy or a basic plan (hereinafter referred to as 'the strategy'). As for AI, ensuring  safety  and  security  is  important  for  promoting  the  use  of  AI,  promoting  innovation, responding to national security risks, preventing crimes, etc., so the strategy should contribute to promoting safe and secure research and development and use of AI. The strategy should include measures  that  require  the  whole  government  to  work  together  to  promote  innovation  with mitigating risks while ensuring international cooperation.\n\nThe above should be legislated to strengthen the function of a strategic leadership board for AI and clarify its authority that the board can request cooperation from related administrative agencies.\n\n## \uff08\uff12\uff09 Improving safety\n\nTo  improve  the  safety  of  AI,  it  is  necessary  at  least  to  ensure  the  transparency  and appropriateness in the lifecycle from research and development to use. It is also considered that it will be effective to utilize a third-party certification or safety evaluations which business operators voluntary undertake. Furthermore, the government should survey the actual status regarding a technology of AI rapidly promoting and its usage trends to provide information, and, as necessary, request relevant stakeholders to take actions.\n\nTo implement these measures, it is necessary for the public and private to cooperate and work together  because  information  sharing  and  cooperation  from  related  stakeholders  including business operators are essential.\n\n## \u2460 Ensuring the transparency and appropriateness through AI life cycle\n\nFrom research and development to use of AI, for example, in the case of using a large amount of training data to construct models, performing fine-tuning, transferring them from developers to providers, and then trained further by providers, and the AI services are provided to users, the  ability  of  the AI  systems  which  developers  developed  and  that  of  the AI  systems  when providers provide the AI services to users are likely to be different and the result of risk evaluation also might be different. While users cannot always grasp how to mitigate risks at the point of development, when mitigating risks, if the necessary information regarding such risks is not appropriately  shared  with  stakeholders,  there  is  a  possibility  that  providers  will  provide  AI systems to users based on misunderstanding, or that users will use AI services inappropriately, resulting in the risks becoming apparent.\n\nFor this reason, to ensure the safe and secure research and development and use of AI, transparency should be ensured to share the necessary information between developers and providers,  and  providers  and  users.  On  the  other  hand,  at  this  stage  of  research  and development, it has not been yet put to a practical use, and information regarding research and development is likely to be related to confidential information of companies. It is thus important to  limit  information  sharing  to  a  truly  essential  extent  so  that  measures  to  ensure  such transparency  try  not  to  fall  into  excessive  burdens  on  business  operations  or  extensive information disclosures of business operators.\n\nAs  for  appropriateness,  the  'Hiroshima  Process  International  Guiding  Principles  for All AI Actors' agreed upon in the Hiroshima AI Process required AI actors to identify and mitigate risks and incidents when developing advanced AI systems and before and after putting them into the market, and to promote the trustworthy and responsible use, etc., and various discussions are being  held  in AISI,  ISO,  etc.  in  other  countries,  and  it  is  necessary  to  promote  appropriate research and development and use.\n\nTo ensure appropriateness, it is appropriate for the government to develop guidance based on the spirit of international norms such as the Hiroshima AI Process, and to encourage business\n\noperators to take voluntary actions in accordance with various norms. As for the guidance, it is important to consider that, for example, AI developers have to construct measures to constrain inappropriate output, and disclose and share information related to concept or risks of AI and proper transparency of training data sets should be supported.\n\nFurthermore, to ensure transparency and appropriateness, the government should ascertain the situation of business operators by surveys and should provide necessary support including responses in accordance with existing laws based on the results. As it is not possible for the government  to  ascertain  the  situation  of  business  operators  or  provide  necessary  support without the cooperation of business operators, it is appropriate to respond by legal systems so that the government can request a cooperation including information sharing from domestic and overseas business operators.\n\nAs countermeasures against disinformation and misinformation, there are some examples in other countries where it becomes a part of obligations that customers are informed that services are with using AI or that contents created by AI are indicated as a creation by AI, and it needs to be  paid  attention  to.  In  addition,  to  ensure  transparency  and  appropriateness,  technical responses such as digital  watermarking 7   or  digital  provenance 8 ,  etc.,  are  also  important.  In relation to this, in September 2024, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications \"Study Group on How to Ensure the Soundness of Information Distribution in the Digital Space,\" pointed out that with regard to disinformation and misinformation, it is important to promote research and development,  and  social  implementation  of  technology  that  judges  whether  information  is generated by AI or not, or technology ensuring trustworthiness of information contents and their senders, and the study group proposed specific measures to the government.\n\n## \u2461 Strategic  promotion  related  to  safety  evaluation  and  certification  implemented  by domestic and overseas organizations\n\nIn  promoting  the  safe  and  secure  use  of AI,  the  implementation  of  safety  evaluation  and certification systems is one of effective means. Safety evaluation and certification systems can be generally categorized into those related to the evaluation and certification of AI systems and those related to the evaluation and certification of governance, etc. for organizations using AI.\n\nAs  for  the  safety  evaluation  of  AI  systems,  developers,  providers  and  users  of  AI  who understand the risks should basically carry out their own risk assessments and take actions by utilizing internal and external expert teams or evaluation tools. If a useful third-party certification is established in the future, it is conceivable that AI developers and providers will obtain such\n\n7 Digital watermarking is a technology that embeds identification information in contents to show that it is generated by AI, such as 'SynthID.'\n\n8   Digital provenance is a technology that attaches provenance information of the creators, etc. to the contents in a verifiable form, such as 'Originator Profile' and 'C2PA.'\n\ncertification,  and  that  many  users,  including  general  citizens,  and  providers  who  have  not handled AI services so far, will also evaluate the safety of AI. Providers and users will be able to recognize and select AI business operators with high levels of security or AI systems which these operators create, based on whether or not they are labeled by the third-party certification.\n\nOn the other hand, with regard to governance for organizations using AI, there will be cases where  the  users  build  system  by  themselves  and  evaluate  on  their  own,  or  a  third-party certification is used. A third-party certification system is thought to be one of the measures that will  promote the safe and secure use of AI and contribute to the vitalization of AI industry in Japan.\n\nGovernance  certification  of  AI  systems  and  organizations  using  AI  is  currently  being considered in the context of ISO.\n\nSafety is already regulated by individual laws such as the Electrical Appliances and Materials Safety Act (Act No. 234, 1961) and the Act on Securing Quality, Efficacy and Safety of Products Including Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices (Act No. 145, 1960), and also responded by \"AI Guidelines for Business\". Furthermore, discussions are also being held in AISI communities of each country, ISO, IEC, and other organizations.\n\nActivities  to  create  international  criteria  and  standards  are  important  for  ensuring  the interoperability of AI systems in the future global market and need to be addressed proactively and strategically.\n\nFurthermore, the development of legal systems in Japan should be based on international norms  and  taken  into  account  the  effectiveness  of  the  systems.  When  implementing  AI evaluation and certification, if their levels can be set according to the users and purposes of use, or if a system which reduces the burden on users to confirm a certain level of safety can be established,  or  a  system  which  certifies  organizations  that  implement  the  evaluation  and certification can be established, it is conceivable that the system will become more effective and sustainable. However, when building this system, on the premise of the activities of AISI, ISO, and other initiatives, it is necessary to consider in detail which stakeholders are involved and what criteria are used for evaluation. In order to ensure AI safety, AISI is expected to continue to work with relevant ministries on research, analysis, organization, and information dissemination, and to support organizations that will serve as a strategic leadership board.\n\n## \u2462 Investigation  and  information  dissemination  by  the  government  regarding  serious incidents.\n\nAs mentioned above, AI has been developing rapidly in recent years, and various risks are increasing.  In  this  situation,  in  order  to  mitigate  the  risks  of AI  and  implement  appropriate measures as the government, it is appropriate for the government to  provide  information  to citizens to essential extent so that first, the government collects and ascertains information of\n\nactual status related to development, provision and usages of AI which has been changing from aspects of both technology and business activities. And then business operators can use AI effectively and appropriately while citizens can deepen their understanding and being interested in promotion of research and development, and use of AI, at the same time when companies fulfill accountability while the government respects their confidential. In particular, with regard to AI models that many citizens use daily, the government should collect information related to safety and the transparency of AI including risks measures of supply chain and provide the information broadly to citizens, and then users will be able to recognize and select AI providers with high levels of safety and their AI systems. Besides, it is important for the government to collect information regarding actual status of AI introduction in infrastructure services, etc.\n\nIn addition, if serious accidents caused by use of AI actually occur, the government will need to  take  measures  to  prevent  its  escalation  or  recurrence,  as  well  as  to  raise  awareness  of recurrence prevention measures by business operators that develop and provide AI. In other words, in terms of AI used in Japan, in the event where it is detected that serious problems which infringe on the rights and interests of citizens arise or are likely to arise, the cause of problems should  be  investigated,  and,  as  necessary,  guidance  and  advice  should  be  provided  to stakeholders, and the investigated information should be made known to citizens. It is important to judge whether or not it can be said that incidents have occurred, based on cases or knowledge piled in the government through the information collection and ascertainment mentioned above.\n\nThis survey and dissemination of information cannot be carried out without the cooperation of business operators, so it is appropriate to respond by legal systems so that the government can require domestic and overseas business operators to cooperate to provide information.\n\n## \uff12 .  Use by the government\n\nThe rates of using AI by individuals and companies in Japan are significantly lower compared to in other countries 9 . AI is expected as a foundation of the development of people's lives and economic activities  to  increase  importance  of  its  use.  However,  if  the  situation  is  overlooked,  it  is  likely  to undermine Japan's international competitiveness instead. For this reason, it is considered that, to begin with, the government should take the lead in using AI and then encourage citizens to use it.\n\n9   According to the 2024 White Paper on Information and Communications by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and  Communications,  in  Japan,  only  9.1%  of  individuals  use  generative AI  (China  (56.3%),  the  U.S. (46.3%), UK (39.8%), and Germany (34.6%)), and in a survey to companies, the percentage of companies using generative AI in their business was 46.8% (the U.S. (84.7%), China (84.4%), and Germany (72.7%))\n\n## \uff08\uff11\uff09 Government procurement\n\nThe government's indication of basic approach to using AI is also useful from the perspective of encouraging  AI  developers  and  providers  who  are  considering  participating  in  government procurement to take their own initiatives to enhance safety.\n\nWhen  the  government  procures  information  systems,  based  on  the  'Agreement  on  the Procurement Policy and Procurement Procedures for Goods, and Services of the State related to IT  Procurement'  (agreement  between  relevant government  agencies  on  December  10,  2018), regarding procurement deemed necessary to respond to supply chain risks, actions are to be taken by necessary measures after consulting with National center of Incident readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity and Digital Agency, and AI is also subject to the agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, so far, there are no guidelines that are specific to AI procurement, but there are various risks associated with AI, as mentioned above. Therefore, to mitigate the risks, it is important to develop government procurement guidelines specific to AI that can be used as a reference when the government procures AI, or to deepen operation of the existing guidelines related to AI.\n\nIn addition, the development of guidelines related to such government procurement may be able to contribute business operators using AI to utilize some kind of AI systems or services, leading to promotion of the spread of AI with high levels of safety.\n\nIn  developing  guidelines,  while  aiming  to  mitigate  risks  and  assure  quality  of AI,  if  ensuring transparency is required, companies' burdens should be taken into consideration according to use cases. This should be done in a way that allows for easy and quick participation by many business operators.\n\n## \uff08\uff12\uff09 Use by the government\n\nThe  government  can  improve  the  quality  and  efficiency  of  administrative  services  and operations by using AI. In addition, the government can promote AI use and can contribute to the development of the domestic AI market by showing use cases and AI usefulness, and informing specific examples and points to note. Therefore, it is important that the government takes the lead in using AI. However, matters that could have a significant impact on the rights and interests of  citizens  should  be  carefully  considered  in  light  of  the  risks 10 of  automatically  adopting  the output results of AI.\n\n10   There are some cases of risk occurrence overseas: the case of unemployment insurance in the United States  was  that  the  integrated  data  automation  system  used  by  the  Michigan  Department  of Unemployment Insurance to detect fraud by claimants recorded 93% of errors over a two-year period from 2013, falsely accusing 20,000 state residents of fraud, and the case of teachers losing their jobs was that the Houston Independent School District introduced a value-added model (VAM) to estimate the impact of\n\nLocal governments also account for a large part of administrative services, and they have a significant impact on people's lives, so it is important to promote the use of AI and enhance their quality  and  efficiency  of  administrative  services  and  operations,  etc.  In  addition,  when  local governments promote the use of AI, they can refer to examples of use including the advanced initiatives of each local government 11 , and the use of AI in response to the regional issues of each local government is also significant.\n\nAs for the use of AI services by the government, etc., according to 'Agreement on the Business Use of Generative AI such as ChatGPT (2nd Edition)' (September 15, 2023, Agreement of the Executive  Board  of  the  Digital  Society  Promotion  Council),  the  government  cannot  handle confidential information on cloud services that are provided to unspecified large number of users and are available only by agreements to standard contracts or rules. In cases of considering the use of generative AI based on individual contracts, etc., the government can handle some of the class 2 confidential information on cloud services only if they conduct to analyze risks properly after obtaining approval from the government's AI Strategic Team. When the government uses AI, it needs to pay attention to handle confidential information and follows the agreements mentioned above, and as necessary, it is important to update by referring to initiatives 12 in other countries.\n\nFurthermore, it is significant to implement measures for reskilling or literacy improvement to encourage citizens to use AI.\n\n## \uff13 .    Matters related to life and body safety, systemic risks and national security\n\nIt is considered necessary to particularly focus on dealing with matters such as medical devices, self-driving cars, and infrastructure services, etc., that are related to people's life and body safety as teachers on students' academic growth, and used it to deny contract update or dismiss teachers from 2007 to 2016, so many teachers sought judicial relief to stop the use of VAM.\n\n11 Kobe  City  established  the AI  ordinance  in  March  2024,  aiming  at  effective  and  safe  use  of AI  in accordance with certain rules, and the city has also been promoting the use of AI such as summarizing text, formulating ideas, and generating programming codes (as referred to Material 3 at the 2nd meeting of the AI Institutional Study Group).\n\nAlso, Tokyo Metropolitan Government has been promoting initiatives: it established and revised the guideline and held Tokyo Metropolitan Government AI Strategic Council in December 2024.\n\n12 Other countries provide guidelines and training programs of the use of AI for their government agencies . For example, the Canadian government published the guide of using generative AI for federal government officers in September 2023. In addition, the government of California, the U.S., published the guideline in March 2024 for generative AI products that state government agencies purchase, and began providing training programs on the procurement of generative AI for state government officers. The EU AI Act, which passed in May 2024, also includes the evaluation and promotion of best practices in public procurement procedures related to AI systems as one of the 'measures that the AI Office takes.'\n\nwell  as  systemic  risks 13 which  specifically  have  a  significant  impact  on  people's  lives  and  social activities, but each government ministry and agency responsible for each sector responds based on existing  business  acts,  and  as  necessary,  they  are  also  in  a  state  of  dialogue  with  the  business industries  regarding  the  development  or  use  cases  of AI  technology to  determine  whether  or not additional measures are needed.\n\nSo far, each ministry and agency should continue to respond under the existing laws and guidelines, but in the future, if new risks emerge and cannot be dealt with by using existing frameworks, the government should consider reviewing legal systems or establishing new legal systems after clarifying the  interpretation  of  relevant  frameworks. As  for  systemic  risks,  large-scale AI  systems  in  which multiple AI systems work together may support social systems in the future, and since if such groups of AI systems behave in unexpected ways, it could cause great confusion throughout the society, it is important to deal with such cases appropriately.\n\nFurthermore,  in  terms  of  risks  regarding  national  security  such  as  the  development  of  CBRN weapons or the use of AI for cyberattacks, it is necessary for the relevant ministries to further consider the necessary responses from the perspective of ensuring Japan's national security.\n\n## IV.  Conclusion\n\nWhile legal systems related to AI are being developed in other countries, considering the above, Japan should establish guidance for widely used AI to achieve the promotion of innovation while mitigating risks. Additionally, while encouraging business operators to take the lead in ensuring the transparency and appropriateness, on the natural premise of ensuring the safety of life and body, and national  security,  the  government  should  investigate  and  ascertain  conditions  of  various  risk mitigations,  including  actual  measures  taken  in  development  and  use  of AI.  Moreover,  if  serious problems occur or are likely to occur, the government should take actions based on the existing laws, provide necessary support, or other actions. Specifically,  technological  innovation  of AI  has  been occurring rapidly around the world, and therefore, the government needs to conduct systems which allows it to ascertain and respond situations as soon as possible. As for the procurement and use by the  government  as  well  as  infrastructure  services,  etc.,  while  continuing  dialogue  with  business sectors, the government should firstly respond through relevant acts and guidelines. Like this, it is important to establish risk governance through the cooperation of public and private sectors.\n\nIn establishing and handling the above-mentioned guidance by the government, and investigating and comprehending actual status related to AI, while voluntary actions by business operators are important, it is necessary to ensure effectiveness. Therefore, considering the impacts on business operators' activities, the implementation should be carried out through legal systems. In introducing\n\n13 They are the risks that malfunction in specific systems will spread to relevant systems, causing serious impacts on wide areas.\n\nthese legal systems, it is necessary to comply with the basic principles of rule of law, due procedure, democratic and responsible administrative, and fundamental human rights, especially the right of privacy etc., which confirmed in the Hiroshima AI process, and to be careful of ensuring that legal systems do not hinder promoting innovation of AI.\n\nBased on this report, we expect the government to promptly implement social systems, including legal systems related to AI, to make development and usage of AI the friendliest, to be based on human-centered values which serve as a model for other countries.", "metadata": {"country": "Japan", "year": 2025, "legally_binding": "no", "binding_proof": NaN, "date": "2025-02-04 00:00:00", "regulator": "AI Strategic Council / AI Institutional Study Group", "type": NaN, "status": "enacted", "language": "English", "use_cases": "[1,2,3,4,5,6]"}}
{"_id": "686d8264f01869c74f4159d2", "title": "Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems", "source": "https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/100573473.pdf", "text": "## H iroshima Process International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems\n\nOn the basis of the Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles for Organizations Developing Advanced  AI  systems,  the  Hiroshima  Process  International  Code  of  Conduct  for  Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems aims to promote safe, secure, and trustworthy AI worldwide and will  provide  voluntary  guidance  for  actions  by  organizations  developing  the  most  advanced  AI systems, including the most advanced foundation models and generative AI systems (henceforth \"advanced AI systems\").\n\nOrganizations should follow these actions in line with a risk-based approach.\n\nOrganizations that may endorse this Code of Conduct  may include, among others, entities from academia, civil society, the private sector, and/or the public sector.\n\nThis non-exhaustive list of actions is discussed and elaborated as a living document to build on the existing OECD AI Principles in response to the recent developments in advanced AI systems and  is  meant  to  help  seize  the  benefits  and  address  the  risks  and  challenges  brought  by  these technologies. Organizations should apply these actions to all stages of the lifecycle to cover, when and as applicable, the design, development, deployment and use of advanced AI systems.\n\nThis  document  will  be  reviewed  and  updated  as  necessary,  including  through  ongoing  inclusive multistakeholder consultations, in order to ensure it remains fit for purpose and responsive to this rapidly evolving technology.\n\nDifferent  jurisdictions  may  take  their  own  unique  approaches  to  implementing  these  actions  in different ways.\n\nWe call on organizations in consultation with other relevant stakeholders to follow these actions, in line  with  a  risk-based  approach,  while  governments  develop  more  enduring  and/or  detailed governance and regulatory approaches. We also commit to develop proposals, in consultation with the  OECD,  GPAI  and  other  stakeholders,  to  introduce  monitoring  tools  and  mechanisms  to  help organizations stay accountable for the implementation of these actions. We encourage organizations to support the development of effective monitoring mechanisms, which we may explore to develop, by contributing best practices.\n\nIn addition, we encourage organizations to set up internal AI governance structures and policies, including  self-assessment  mechanisms,  to  facilitate  a  responsible  and  accountable  approach  to implementation of these actions and in AI development.\n\nWhile  harnessing  the  opportunities  of  innovation,  organizations  should  respect  the  rule  of  law, human  rights,  due  process,  diversity,  fairness  and  non-discrimination,  democracy,  and  humancentricity, in the design, development and deployment of advanced AI systems.\n\nOrganizations should not develop or deploy advanced AI systems in ways that undermine democratic values, are particularly harmful to individuals or communities, facilitate terrorism, promote criminal misuse, or pose substantial risks to safety, security and human rights, and are thus not acceptable.\n\nStates must abide by their obligations under international human rights law to ensure that human rights  are  fully  respected  and  protected,  while  private  sector  activities  should  be  in  line  with international frameworks such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nSpecifically,  we  call  on  organizations  to  abide  by  the  following  actions,  in  a  manner  that  is commensurate to the risks:\n\n## 1  Take  appropriate  measures  throughout  the  development  of  advanced  AI  systems, including  prior  to  and  throughout  their  deployment  and  placement  on  the  market,  to identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks across the AI lifecycle.\n\nThis  includes  employing  diverse  internal  and  independent  external  testing  measures,  through  a combination  of  methods  for  evaluations,  such  as  red-teaming,  and  implementing  appropriate mitigation to address identified risks and vulnerabilities. Testing and mitigation measures, should, for example, seek to ensure the trustworthiness, safety and security of systems throughout their entire lifecycle so that they do not pose unreasonable risks. In support of such testing, developers should seek to enable traceability, in relation to datasets, processes, and decisions made during system development. These measures should be documented and supported by regularly updated technical documentation.\n\nThis  testing  should  take  place  in  secure  environments  and  be  performed  at  several  checkpoints throughout the AI lifecycle in particular before deployment and placement on the market to identify risks and vulnerabilities, and to inform action to address the identified AI risks to security, safety and societal and other risks, whether accidental or intentional. In designing and implementing testing\n\nmeasures, organizations commit to devote attention to the following risks as appropriate:\n\n- &gt; Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, such as the ways in which advanced AI systems can  lower  barriers  to  entry,  including  for  non-state  actors,  for  weapons  development,  design acquisition, or use.\n- &gt; Offensive cyber capabilities, such as the ways in which systems can enable vulnerability discovery, exploitation,  or  operational  use,  bearing  in  mind  that  such  capabilities  could  also  have  useful defensive applications and might be appropriate to include in a system.\n- &gt; Risks to health and/or Safety, including the effects of system interaction and tool use, including for example the capacity to control physical systems and interfere with critical infrastructure.\n- &gt; Risks from models of making copies of themselves or 'self-replicating' or training other models.\n- &gt; Societal risks, as well as risks to individuals and communities such as the ways in which advanced AI  systems  or  models  can  give  rise  to  harmful  bias  and  discrimination  or  lead  to  violation  of applicable legal frameworks, including on privacy and data protection.\n- &gt; Threats to democratic values and human rights, including the facilitation of disinformation or harming privacy.\n- &gt; Risk that a particular event could lead to a chain reaction with considerable negative effects that could affect up to an entire city, an entire domain activity or an entire community.\n\nOrganizations commit to work in collaboration with relevant actors across sectors, to assess and adopt mitigation measures to address these risks, in particular systemic risks.\n\nOrganizations  making  these  commitments  should  also  endeavor  to  advance  research  and investment on the security, safety, bias and disinformation, fairness, explainability and interpretability,  and  transparency  of  advanced  AI  systems  and  on  increasing  robustness  and trustworthiness of advanced AI systems against misuse.\n\n## 2 Identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, and, where appropriate, incidents and patterns of misuse, after deployment including placement on the market.\n\nOrganizations should use, as and when appropriate commensurate to the level of risk, AI systems as intended and monitor for vulnerabilities, incidents, emerging risks and misuse after deployment,\n\nand take appropriate action to address these. Organizations are encouraged to consider, for example, facilitating  third-party  and  user  discovery  and  reporting  of  issues  and  vulnerabilities  after deployment  such  as  through  bounty  systems,  contests,  or  prizes  to  incentivize  the  responsible disclosure of weaknesses. Organizations are further encouraged to maintain appropriate documentation  of  reported  incidents  and  to  mitigate  the  identified  risks  and  vulnerabilities,  in collaboration  with  other  stakeholders.  Mechanisms  to  report  vulnerabilities,  where  appropriate, should be accessible to a diverse set of stakeholders.\n\n## 3 Publicly report advanced AI systems' capabilities, limitations and domains of appropriate and inappropriate use, to support ensuring sufficient transparency, thereby contributing to increase accountability.\n\nThis should include publishing transparency reports containing meaningful information for all new significant releases of advanced AI systems.\n\nThese reports, instruction for use and relevant technical documentation, as appropriate as, should be kept up-to-date and should include, for example;\n\n- &gt; Details of the evaluations conducted for potential safety, security, and societal risks, as well as risks to human rights,\n- &gt; Capacities of a model/system and significant limitations in performance that have implications for the domains of appropriate use,\n- &gt; Discussion and assessment of the model's or system's effects and risks to safety and society such as harmful bias, discrimination, threats to protection of privacy or personal data, and effects on fairness, and\n- &gt; The results of red-teaming conducted to evaluate the model's/system's fitness for moving beyond the development stage.\n\nOrganizations  should  make  the  information  in  the  transparency  reports  sufficiently  clear  and understandable  to  enable  deployers  and  users  as  appropriate  and  relevant  to  interpret  the model/system's output and to enable users to use it appropriately; and that transparency reporting should  be  supported  and  informed  by  robust  documentation  processes  such  as  technical documentation and instructions for use.\n\n- 4 Work  towards  responsible  information  sharing  and  reporting  of  incidents  among organizations developing advanced AI systems including with industry, governments, civil society, and academia\n\nThis  includes  responsibly  sharing  information,  as  appropriate,  including,  but  not  limited  to evaluation  reports,  information  on  security  and  safety  risks,  dangerous  intended  or  unintended capabilities, and attempts by AI actors to circumvent safeguards across the AI lifecycle.\n\nOrganizations  should  establish  or  join  mechanisms  to  develop,  advance,  and  adopt,  where appropriate,  shared  standards,  tools,  mechanisms,  and  best  practices  for  ensuring  the  safety, security, and trustworthiness of advanced AI systems.\n\nThis should also include ensuring appropriate and relevant documentation and transparency across the AI lifecycle in particular for advanced AI systems that cause significant risks to safety and society.\n\nOrganizations should collaborate with other organizations across the AI lifecycle to share and report relevant information to the public with a view to advancing safety, security and trustworthiness of advanced  AI  systems.  Organizations  should  also  collaborate  and  share  the  aforementioned information with relevant public authorities, as appropriate.\n\nSuch reporting should safeguard intellectual property rights.\n\n## 5 Develop, implement and disclose AI governance and risk management policies, grounded in a risk-based approach - including privacy policies, and mitigation measures.\n\nOrganizations should put in place appropriate organizational mechanisms to develop, disclose and implement  risk  management  and  governance  policies,  including  for  example  accountability  and governance processes to identify, assess, prevent, and address risks, where feasible throughout the AI lifecycle.\n\nThis includes disclosing where appropriate privacy policies, including for personal data, user prompts and  advanced  AI  system  outputs.  Organizations  are  expected  to  establish  and  disclose  their  AI governance policies and organizational mechanisms to implement these policies in accordance with a risk-based approach. This should include accountability and governance processes to evaluate and mitigate risks, where feasible throughout the AI lifecycle.\n\nThe risk management policies should be developed in accordance with a risk-based approach and apply a risk management framework across the AI lifecycle as appropriate and relevant, to address the range of risks associated with AI systems, and policies should also be regularly updated.\n\nOrganizations should establish policies, procedures, and training to ensure that staff are familiar with their duties and the organization's risk management practices\n\n## 6 Invest in and implement robust security controls, including physical security, cybersecurity and insider threat safeguards across the AI lifecycle.\n\nThese may include securing model weights and, algorithms, servers, and datasets, such as through operational  security  measures  for  information  security  and  appropriate  cyber/physical  access controls.\n\nThis also includes performing an assessment of cybersecurity risks and implementing cybersecurity policies  and  adequate  technical  and  institutional  solutions  to  ensure  that  the  cybersecurity  of advanced  AI  systems  is  appropriate  to  the  relevant  circumstances  and  the  risks  involved. Organizations should also have in place measures to require storing and working with the model weights  of  advanced  AI  systems  in  an  appropriately  secure  environment  with  limited  access  to reduce both the risk of unsanctioned release and the risk of unauthorized access. This includes a commitment to have in place a vulnerability management process and to regularly review security measures to ensure they are maintained to a high standard and remain suitable to address risks.\n\nThis  further  includes  establishing  a  robust  insider  threat  detection  program  consistent  with protections provided for their most valuable intellectual property and trade secrets, for example, by limiting access to proprietary and unreleased model weights.\n\n## 7 Develop and deploy reliable content authentication and provenance mechanisms, where technically feasible, such as watermarking or other techniques to enable users to identify AI-generated content\n\nThis includes, where appropriate and technically feasible, content authentication and provenance mechanisms for content created with an organization's advanced AI system. The provenance data should include an identifier of the service or model that created the content, but need not include user information.

Basic Concept\n\n- \u00b7 The Integrated Innovation Strategy 2024 (hereinafter referred to as \"Integrated Strategy 2024\") is an annual strategy  in  its  fourth  year  positioned  as  an  implementation  plan  of  the  Sixth  Basic  Plan  for  Science, Technology and Innovation (Cabinet decision of March 26, 2021; hereinafter referred to as the \"Sixth STI Basic Plan\"). The Integrated Strategy 2024 is the first step toward making the next Basic Plan for Science, Technology, and Innovation from FY2026, a plan with a long-term vision for the realization of a nation that will create science and technology in the Reiwa era.\n- \u00b7 Science, technology and innovation are driving forces in Japan's economic growth, and their importance is growing even more in solving social issues and responding to disasters. In addition, as the global security environment increases in severity, such as the situation in Ukraine and the situation in Israel and Palestine, competition for leadership over key technologies intensifies, and supply chains are fragmenting on a global scale. On the other hand, there are concerns that the decline in relative research capabilities and the delay in the creation of an innovation ecosystem will significantly impact Japan's economic growth and future job creation.\n- \u00b7 It  is  important  to  further  strengthen  research  capabilities,  industrial  competitiveness,  and  responses  to economic  security  from  a  global  perspective,  and  to  strengthen  cooperation  with  the  international community, including our ally and like-minded countries such as the G7, as well as the Global South, including ASEAN and India.\n- \u00b7 In Japan, automation and labor-saving through AI and robotics are urgently needed as manpower shortages worsen, and preparedness and response to frequently occurring disasters are also urgent issues. As science, technology and innovation play even more important roles in these areas, the social implementation of technology shall be accelerated.\n- \u00b7 While investment in science, technology and innovation continues to increase over time in other countries, investment in R&amp;D by Japanese private companies has remained flat. Although domestic investment is showing signs of expansion, as shown by the fact that firms' willingness to invest in capital investment, which had been sluggish, is at its highest level since 1983, and the amount of capital investment by private companies is expected to be 104.8 trillion yen in FY2024, it is extremely important that the public and private sectors continue to make bold R&amp;D investments in cooperation with each other in order to survive fierce competition among countries with the awareness that this is the last chance to connect this 'turn of the  tide'  to  continuous  growth,  and  that  the  results  of  such  investments  be  implemented  and commercialized in society to lead to economic growth in Japan.\n- \u00b7 Under the Integrated Strategy 2024, we will continue to promote policies based on the three pillars of \"strategic promotion of advanced science and technology,\" \"enhancement of knowledge bases (research capabilities) and human resource development,\" and \"creation of an innovation ecosystem,\" and we will also  promote  an  \"integrated  strategy  for  key  technologies,\"  \"strengthening  cooperation  from  a  global perspective,\" and \"enhancing competitiveness and ensuring safety and security in the AI field\" as the three strengthening measures.\n- \u00b7 In order to realize Society 5.0, we will steadily grasp and evaluate the progress of the Sixth STI Basic Plan, continuously grasp and analyze changes in the situation and latest trends in Japan and overseas using eCSTI, etc., and reflect these research conclusions in science, technology and innovation policies to promote measures efficiently and effectively.\n\n## 2. Three to Strengthening Measures\n\n## (1) Integrated Strategy for Key Technologies\n\n- \u00b7 Fusion energy and quantum technologies are emerging technologies that will spawn new industries. AI, biotechnology, materials, semiconductors, and Beyond 5G (6G) are fundamental technologies that support Japan's economy and society, and they are becoming increasingly important in Japan's economic growth. With  regard  to  these  key  technologies,  we  will  strongly  promote  R&amp;D,  industrialization,  and  human resource development by integrating technologies across fields from a bird's-eye perspective.\n\n## \u2460 R&amp;D by Developing Core Technologies and Integrating Technologies with Other Strategic Areas\n\n- \u00b7 As a source of Japan's international competitiveness, R&amp;D of core technologies in each field is becoming increasingly important not only from the viewpoint of securing superiority in the international community but also from the viewpoint of economic security. In light of this situation, we will strongly promote the development of core technologies that can become game changers in the global market through IndustryAcademia-Government Collaborations and the implementation of bounty type projects. In order to further promote science, technology and innovation policies, the national government will organize the purpose and effective use of new policy tools such as bounty type projects, in addition to existing policy tools such as subsidies and outsourcing costs.\n- \u00b7 We will also engage in R&amp;D by integrating technologies with other strategic fields, and accelerate the creation of new R&amp;D results and their implementation in society. Specifically, through integration with AI, quantum,  robotics,  and  IoT  technologies,  we  will  promote  automation  and  speedup  of  R&amp;D  and manufacturing processes, and increase efficiency and sophistication of R&amp;D through data analysis using AI, etc.\n- \u00b7 In addition, we will strengthen our technology intelligence functions to explore and identify frontier areas, and provide priority support to frontier areas that will sprout new industries.\n\n## \u2461 Establishment of Domestic Infrastructure and Promotion of Innovation by Startups\n\n- \u00b7 In the field of advanced science and technology, markets are developing or have not yet been formed on a global scale. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that developing a global market as a blue ocean will be the key to the subsequent leadership battle.\n- \u00b7 In order to secure an advantage in new markets, we will promote the early creation of use cases and markets by  industry,  academia,  and  government  as  an  exit  strategy  for  R&amp;D.  We  will  also  strengthen  the development and utilization of test beds and the accumulation of data and know-how as bases and hub functions for this purpose.\n- \u00b7 Startups are also important players that play a role in innovation. We will use the bases and hub functions of industry, academia and government to nurture startups and support innovation generation. In particular, we will work to create a strong ecosystem that supports the long-term growth of startups in the field of advanced science and technology, which often requires larger and longer-term funding than other fields.\n\n## \u2462 Developing and Securing Human Resources through Industry, Academia, and Government\n\n- \u00b7 In advancing R&amp;D and commercialization of important technologies in Japan, it is essential to develop and secure human resources who can perform the control tower function and management function from a general perspective, rather than from a partially optimal perspective. Industry, academia, and government will collaborate to promote the following initiatives.\n- \u00b7 In order to bring technology to market, it is necessary to quickly maintain experts who will be responsible\n\nfor the commercialization of technology and integration of production processes and systems. We will work to strengthen the domestic supply capacity of human resources and improve the mobility of industrial human resources.\n\n- \u00b7 In  addition,  in  order  to  develop  new  markets  in  Japan  and  overseas,  we  will  work  to  develop  human resources, including the formation of human networks in various foreign countries and regions, because there will be many situations in which building alliances with relevant players and dealing with regulations, systems, and standards will be required.\n- \u00b7 In addition, from the viewpoint of expanding markets over the long term, it is necessary to develop highly skilled human resources who will carry out R&amp;D of advanced science and technology. We will work to develop R&amp;D human resources who can adapt to new research methods while utilizing knowledge not only from specialized fields but also from other fields.\n\n## (2) Strengthening Collaboration from a Global Perspective\n\n## \u2460 Leading and Participating in International Rulemaking\n\n- \u00b7 In order to implement R&amp;D results and innovations in society, rulemaking, which defines how new markets should  be,  is  extremely  important.  With  regard  to  important  technologies  such  as  AI,  fusion  energy, quantum technology, biotechnology, and materials, we will lead and participate in international rulemaking in promoting development, use, and ensuring safety, while collaborating with the international community.\n- \u00b7 In recent years, EU countries, the United States, China, and other countries have focused on international standardization, which can be done independently by private companies, as an effective means of securing competitiveness.  In  order  to  take  the  initiative  from  the  viewpoint  of  economic  security,  they  have strengthened  their  comprehensive  national  standards  strategies  to  compete  with  each  other,  and  have focused  their  political  resources  on  these  initiatives.  While  Japan  is  further  advancing  its  strategic international  standardization  activities,  Japan  will  strengthen  the  government's  control  tower  function, develop measures to develop and implement international standards strategies through industry-academiagovernment collaborations, in areas such as key technologies, economic security, and environmental rules, that carry large impact on industry and society, and develop measure to sustainably strengthen its capacities.\n- \u00b7 Regarding the implementation to promote and strengthen international standards strategies and open and close strategies by private companies and universities will be further promoted and laterally expanded in government R&amp;D projects, support projects, and other projects, based on the effective efforts being made through the Green Innovation Fund Projects and the Beyond 5G (6G) Fund Project. In these projects, from the early stages of R&amp;D, as business strategy activities to secure international competitiveness and promote social implementation, efforts are being made to raise the level of commitment of private management regarding international standardization, strengthen internal systems and human resources, and strongly encourage international alliances.\n- \u00b7 In  rulemaking, it is necessary for industry, academia, and government to share and implement Japan's policy of making strategic use of bilateral and multilateral frameworks and alliances, starting with our ally, like-minded countries, and ASEAN, from the perspectives of Japan's advantage in the global supply chains and securing markets, as well as the perspective of strengthening the global supply chains from which Japan benefits. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen human resources and support organizations in Japan involved in international rulemaking, promote business models that promote management strategies and international standardization activities in an integrated manner, and develop an ecosystem in which rulemaking is autonomously promoted by private companies and others, as in the West. To this end, Japan will formulate a comprehensive standard strategy in around spring 2025 and strengthen and promote related\n\nmeasures.\n\n## \u2461 Strengthening Coordination between Science, Technology and Innovation Policies and Economic Security Policies\n\n- \u00b7 In light of the growing importance of science, technology and innovation in the field of economic security, we will strengthen cooperation between science, technology and innovation policies and economic security policies in both offensive and defensive ways.\n- \u00b7 Specifically,  we  will  promote  strategic  R&amp;D  on  key  technologies  for  economic  security,  including international cooperation and collaboration, such as joint research between countries, and work to ensure research security and integrity and prevent technology leakage.\n\n## \u2462 Active Use of Resources and Strategic Cooperation from a Global Perspective\n\n- \u00b7 As global issues such as climate change and infectious diseases are becoming more serious, geopolitical situations are destabilizing, and the impact of emerging technologies on society is expanding, international cooperation for science and technology is becoming increasingly important.\n- \u00b7 Under these circumstances, in order to further strengthen Japan's research capabilities, generate outstanding research results, and promote science and technology diplomacy based on diplomatic policies such as the realization of a Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) based on the rule of law, it is necessary to actively utilize domestic and international resources through cooperation with our ally and like-minded countries, including the G7, and the Global South, including ASEAN and India, and to promote strategic cooperation. In addition, it is necessary to create an environment in which researchers can devote themselves to overseas research,  promote  international  cooperation  based  on  free  thinking,  and  promote  international  talent mobility and circulation.\n- \u00b7 Specifically,  the  Adopting  Sustainable  Partnerships  for  Innovative  Research  Ecosystem  (ASPIRE) program  will  promote  the  participation  of  researchers  in  the  international  top  science  circle  through strategic support of international joint research with advanced countries such as in Europe and the United States in the field of advanced science and technology and strengthen exchanges and networks of young researchers.\n- \u00b7 With ASEAN countries, the Networked Exchange, United Strength for  Stronger Partnerships between Japan and ASEAN (NEXUS) will promote international joint research, exchange and development of research personnel, and contribute to building sustainable relations between Japan and ASEAN.\n- \u00b7 In addition, we will continue to promote the formation of bases that serve as hubs for international talent mobility and circulation that attract researchers from overseas through the World Premier International Research Center Initiative (hereinafter referred to as \"WPI\"), etc. Moreover, we will further accelerate the internationalization of research by, for example, increasing the amount of research funding allocated to research projects expected to have a high ripple effect internationally in the Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (hereinafter referred to as \"KAKENHI\").\n- \u00b7 In  international  student  exchange,  which  forms  the  basis  for  strategic  collaboration,  we  will  work  to enhance and implement continuous support to promote medium- to long-term study abroad by Japanese students, and promote the recruitment and employment of excellent international students. We will also promote the establishment of  the co-learning environment for domestic and international students, the strengthening  of  inter  university  exchange,  and  the  recruitment  and  training  of  university  staff  with advanced and specialized knowledge in international operations.\n- \u00b7 In addition, through contributions to international organizations, Japan will contribute to solving social\n\nissues in developing countries through the knowledge of science, technology and innovation possessed by Japanese  companies,  and  plan  to  reinforce  Japanese  companies'  technologies  overseas.  We  will  also participate strategically in discussions necessary for Japan through the dispatch of experts to international organizations.\n\n## (3) Enhancing Competitiveness and Ensuring Safety and Security in the AI Field\n\n- \u00b7 Generative AI is considered to be a technological innovation comparable to that of the Internet, and while it will bring about major changes in socioeconomic systems, various risks such as the dissemination of Dis-/Mis-information and the sophistication of crime are pointed out, and safety and security are required.\n- \u00b7 In order to follow the lead of U.S. companies and other companies in developing high-performance and large-scale general-purposed foundation models, Japan is developing computational resources and largescale  models,  and  is  also  advancing  new  research,  such  as  the  development  of  small-scale  and  highperformance models and combinations of multiple models.\n- \u00b7 AI can be used in all fields, and innovations, through such as the development and use of AI can lead directly to solutions to social issues and Japan's competitiveness. In Japan, we aim to form a virtuous cycle that accelerates innovation while suppressing various risks of AI, including generative AI, and ensuring a safe  and  secure  environment.  In  addition,  we  will  continue  to  demonstrate  leadership  internationally through the Hiroshima AI Process and other initiatives that Japan leads.\n\n## \u2460 Accelerating AI Innovation and Innovation by AI\n\n- \u00b7 In addition to developing and securing human resources and upgrading infrastructure such as computing resources, the government and the private sector will work together to promote the use of AI and strengthen R&amp;D capabilities. Data is essential for the evolution of AI, and AI-related policies will be implemented in coordination with data strategies.\n\n## (Strengthening R&amp;D Capabilities (Including Data Improvement))\n\n- \u00b7 To strengthen AI development capabilities, we will improve and expand high-quality Japanese data set and provide it in an appropriate way. In order to develop competitive AI in each field, we will promote data sharing and share good practices.\n- \u00b7 The public and private sectors will continue to work together to make computing resources essential for AI development available to a wide range of developers.\n- \u00b7 We will  collaborate  with  industry  and  academia  in  R&amp;D  to  promote  high  efficiency,  high  precision, multimodalization and risk mitigation of AI model, while supporting startups with innovative technologies.\n- \u00b7 We will accelerate AI for Science in the public and private sectors by strengthening the infrastructure for scientific research data development, which is Japan's strength, in fields such as medicine, drug discovery, and  materials.  We  will  also  start  developing  and  introducing  a  new  flagship  system  with  superior  AI performance that will be the next flagship system.\n- \u00b7 The public and private sectors will advance R&amp;D and implementation of innovative AI robots that can flexibly respond to changes in the environment that contribute to the elimination of labor shortages and GX.\n\n## (Promotion of AI Utilization)\n\n- \u00b7 The government will promote the appropriate procurement and use of AI and the sharing of the obtained knowledge in order to further advance the \"Agreement on Business Use of Generated AI such as ChatGPT\n\n(Ver 2.0)\" based on the formulation of the AI Guidelines for Business and serve as a model for other organizations.\n\n- \u00b7 We will promote the adoption of AI in important fields such as healthcare and robotics.\n- \u00b7 In order to enable users and developers to utilize and develop AI without being overwhelmed, we will clarify  the  operation  of  systems  that  require  attention,  such  as  the  Act  on  the  Protection  of  Personal Information (Act No. 57 of 2003), the Copyright Act (Act No. 48 of 1970), and various business laws.\n\n## (Upgrading of Infrastructure)\n\n- \u00b7 In addition to promoting R&amp;D in order to increase the size and decentralization of data centers, reduce power consumption, and upgrade to cutting-edge network systems such as Beyond 5G (6G), we will expand private investment in infrastructure critical to AI.\n- \u00b7 The government will support the establishment of industry-university collaboration systems for the design, development,  and  operation  of  key  devices  such  as  AI  semiconductors,  R&amp;D,  and  human  resource development.\n- \u00b7 We will consider creating an environment to secure cheap decarbonized electricity.\n\n## (Development and Securing of Human Resources)\n\n- \u00b7 We will enhance and promote educational content for the acquisition of AI skills and improvement of AI literacy. In addition, at the primary and secondary education level, we will further promote pilot initiatives on the use of AI including information ethics.\n- \u00b7 We will support young researchers and doctoral students who will take charge of AI development for the next generation.\n\n## \u2461 Ensuring AI Safety and Security\n\n- \u00b7 In order to promote innovation, we need rules as a guardrail to ensure the safety and security of using AI. In order to respond to changes quickly and flexibly, Japan has a basic policy of encouraging voluntary efforts by businesses operators based on the AI Guidelines for Business. In the future, we will examine how the system should be based on various risks related to AI and international trends in soft law such as specifications and guidelines and hard law such as laws and legal criteria.\n\n## (Consideration of Voluntary Governance and Systems)\n\n- \u00b7 We will publicize and disseminate the AI Guidelines for Business to a wide range of industries.\n- \u00b7 Based on 'The concept for the AI regulation' approved by the AI Strategy Council in May 2024, the AI Regulation Study Group (tentative name), which will be newly established under the AI Strategy Council, will begin to study how the regulation should be.\n- \u00b7 Important fields that have a significant impact on society, such as healthcare, autonomous driving, and finance, will be examined for the need to review the system in accordance with the progress and usage of technology.\n\n## (Consideration of AI Safety)\n\n- \u00b7 The AI Safety Institute (AISI) has been established at the Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan  (IPA)  as  a  central  organization  for  AI  safety.  We  will  foster  and  maintain  experts  at  AISI  and promotes  consolidating  advanced  technological  knowledge.

In addition to creating an environment where young researchers can devote themselves to research, efforts will be made to secure human resources for research support and\n\nenhance competitive research funding for young researchers.\n\n- \u00b7 With the aim of accelerating high-value-added research in the medical field, efforts will be made to create an environment for promoting the appropriate management and use of reliable health and medical data, develop  infrastructure  to  support  medical  research  DX,  and  foster  a  new  research  community  and environment.\n- \u00b7 Strategic  promotion and simulation of vaccine R&amp;D will be implemented to prepare for an infectious disease  emergency.  In  addition,  we  will  establish  an  environment  in  which  scientific  knowledge  on infectious diseases can be generated and R&amp;D and practical application of crisis drugs can be carried out. We  will  also  further  accelerate  preparations  for  the  establishment  of  the  National  Health  Crisis Management Research Organization, which will play a central role, in April 2025.\n- \u00b7 With the aim of capturing a global market for Japan's medical device industry, we will support clinical trials,  etc.  to  capture  the  U.S.  market,  which  is  the  most  important  for  overseas  expansion,  promote innovation  creation  by  strengthening  cooperation  between  startups  and  major  companies,  and  make strategic use of international standards.\n- \u00b7 We will steadily promote the \"Action Plan for Whole Genome Analysis 2022\", and work on formulating a basic plan based on the \"Act on the Comprehensive and Systematic Promotion of Measures to Ensure the Public's  Safe  Access  to  Good  and  Appropriate  Genomic  Medicine\"  (Act  No.  57  of  2023;  \"Genomic Medicine Promotion Act\"), which was promulgated and enforced in June 2023.\n\n## (Space)\n\n## (Securing Space Security)\n\n- \u00b7 In order to realize space security through the three approaches outlined in the Space Security Initiative (National Space Policy Secretariat decision of June 13, 2023), which Japan first formulated in June 2023, \"radically expand the use of space systems for national security,\" \"ensuring safe and stable use of outer space,\" and \"realization of  a virtuous cycle of security and fostering space industrial base,\" it is necessary to establish the necessary space architecture for security at an early stage, including the establishment of a wide-area, high-precision, and high-frequency information collection system, including the strengthening of the functions of information-gathering satellites, the establishment of an information and communications system with high interception and jamming resistance, responses to missile threats, and the enhancement and strengthening of the understanding of the space domain.\n- \u00b7 In recent years, the innovation and commercialization of space technology by private companies has been progressing rapidly. It is important to promote the development of the domestic space industry by actively utilizing private space technology for Japan's defense, thereby realizing a virtuous cycle that will lead to the strengthening of Japan's defense capabilities.\n\n## (National Resilience, Responding to Global Issues and Realizing Innovation)\n\n- \u00b7 In  the  case  of  the  Noto  Peninsula  Earthquake  in  2024,  processed  images  from  information-gathering satellites, data from the Daichi 2 Large Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite, and data from small optical satellites and small SAR satellites from private companies in Japan were used to assess the disaster situation.  In  addition,  satellite  communications  networks  were  used  to  secure  communications  in  the disaster areas, while the terrestrial communications infrastructure was severely damaged.\n- \u00b7 Disaster prevention and mitigation, national resilience, and climate change are pressing issues. In the event of a wide-area or large-scale disaster, it is important to quickly grasp the disaster situation and provide information to relevant organizations. The use of satellite data is one of the powerful methods to this end, and its importance is increasing.\n- \u00b7 In addition to measures for disaster prevention and mitigation using satellite data, it is necessary to respond to  the  worsening climate change problem, realize carbon neutrality, and utilize space systems such as\n\n- autonomous driving, smart cities, and smart agriculture, forestry, and fisheries to solve global issues and create innovation in the private market sector.\n- \u00b7 At the 3rd Ministerial Meeting of the Task Force on the Use of Satellite Remote Sensing Data held on March 26, 2024, the government decided to expand the use of private satellites for three years from FY2024, and in particular, to actively procure and use satellite data provided by domestic startups with technological capabilities in relevant ministries and agencies. In the future, it will be important for the public and private sectors  to  work  together  to  promote  strategic  technology  development  and  demonstration,  and  for  the government to take the lead in promoting service procurement by private companies in order to expand the use of satellite data.\n- \u00b7 As concerns are growing that space phenomena such as solar flares will have an impact on society, space weather forecasts are being used, and further upgrading will be necessary in the future.\n\n## (Creation of New Knowledge and Industry in Space Science and Exploration)\n\n- \u00b7 In  addition to the United States, China, India, and other emerging countries are accelerating efforts to explore the Moon, and international competition is intensifying. Japan must actively participate in and contribute to the Artemis program, which the United States is taking the lead in, and show its own presence internationally. As concurred in the Japan-U.S. Joint Leaders' Statement on April 10, 2024, Japan plans to provide and sustain operation of a pressurized lunar rover while the United States plans to allocate two astronaut flight opportunities to the lunar surface for Japan on future Artemis missions. Furthermore, the leaders announced a shared goal for a Japanese national to be the first non-American astronaut to land on the Moon on a future Artemis mission. Japan will promote the development of a pressurized lunar rover and aim to realize the landing of a Japanese astronaut on the moon in the late 2020s. In January 2024, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) successfully landed  on  the  moon  with  the  highest  precision  in  the  world.  In  the  future,  industry,  academia,  and government need to collaborate to maintain and develop the results of space science and exploration with a view to contributing to the Artemis program.\n- \u00b7 At the same time, it is necessary to promote the public's understanding of the use of space development by publicizing the results of space science and exploration, and to develop future human resources to support the use of space development.\n\n## (Strengthening the Comprehensive Foundation for Supporting Space Activities)\n\n- \u00b7 In order to maintain self-sustaining space activities, it is necessary to secure Japan's launch capacity of approximately 30 launches per year by the first half of the 2030s by building a space transport system that realizes high frequency launches, greater transport capacity, and lower launch prices throughout Japan through the development of core and private rockets and the development of base launch sites and space ports. In addition, it is necessary to develop the institutional environment necessary to realize new space transport businesses such as the prompt launch of rockets, the capture of launch demand for overseas satellites, and suborbital flights.\n- \u00b7 It is necessary to cope with the increased risk of collisions in orbit due to the increase in space objects such as space vehicles and space debris. It is important to contribute to the sustainable, stable, and safe use of space by steadily advancing technology development that contributes to the reduction and removal of space debris, promoting initiatives in line with the \"medium- to long-term policy on making rules for the use of orbit,\" and taking the lead in making international norms and rules.\n- \u00b7 The Summit of the Future to be held by the United Nations in September 2024 will cover topics such as traffic management in outer space and the removal of space debris. It is also important to establish rules through such international cooperation and to promote R&amp;D of new technologies through cooperation with ally and like-minded countries.\n\n- \u00b7 In the Space Technology Strategy (Committee on National Space Policy decision of March 28, 2024), we set out the technologies to be developed and the timeline for their development, with a view to Japan's path to victory. In the future, it is important for the relevant government ministries and agencies to strategically advance from technology development to increase technological maturity (front-loading) to technology development for commercialization and, with a view to strengthening Japan's technological superiority and ensuring the autonomy of the supply chain, while referring to the Strategy.\n- \u00b7 In particular, with regard to the Space Strategy Fund, which was established last year, it is important to commence support for technology development themes to be implemented by utilizing the supplementary budget measures for FY2023, and to promptly aim for support of a total of \u00a51 trillion in order to support the further expansion of activities in the space field by private companies and universities, based on the Comprehensive  Economic  Measures  to  Completely  Break  Free  from  Deflation  (Cabinet  decision  of November 2, 2023).\n- \u00b7 It is also important to create a virtuous cycle for the commercialization of Japanese private companies that have the will, technology, and business models to survive in the international market by connecting the results of such technology development support to the anchor tenancy of the government and others.\n- \u00b7 When implementing projects by the government and others, we will review the contract system while taking national interests into consideration so as to ensure the viability and growth potential of private companies.\n\n## (Ocean)\n\n- \u00b7 The Fourth Basic Plan on Ocean Policy (Cabinet decision of April 28, 2023) defines two main pillars of ocean policy as \"comprehensive maritime security\" and \"building a sustainable ocean.\" In addition, among the measures of the Fourth Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, the \" Ocean Development Strategy (Headquarters for Ocean Policy decision of April 26, 2024)\" was formulated, consisting of six important missions that should be addressed across ministries from the viewpoint of national interests.

In order to promote\n\nthe active participation of doctoral talents in industry, we will conduct cross-ministerial studies to formulate guidelines for companies, universities, etc., and disseminate the attractiveness of doctoral talents through PR of role models. In addition, we will encourage business organizations to promote understanding of the importance  of  doctoral  talents  in  a  wide  range  of  industries,  etc.  Furthermore,  we  will  promote  the acquisition  of  doctoral  degrees  by  private  sector  employees  through  joint  research,  while  utilizing  a mechanism for finding (matching) talented young researchers between companies and universities. We aim to  strengthen  research  capabilities  and  innovation  creation  through  the  active  participation  of  doctoral talents.\n\n## (Promotion of the Active Participation of Female Researchers)\n\n- \u00b7 From the viewpoint of improving diversity in research and the research environment, we will accelerate the active participation of female researchers through the elimination of gender gaps, etc. Based on the Sixth STI Basic Plan and the Fifth Basic Plan for Gender Equality (Cabinet decision of December 25, 2020), we will continue to steadily enact initiatives to further promote the careers of female researchers, including in leadership positions, by supporting the efforts of universities and other institutions to create an environment where life events such as childbirth and childcare can be balanced with research, and to realize diversity, equity, and inclusion in the research environment.\n\n(Promotion of Measures Based on the Policy Package on Education and Human Resource Development for the Realization of Society 5.0)\n\n- \u00b7 Based on the Policy Package on Education and Human Resource Development for the Realization of Society 5.0, we will promote (1) the diversification of \"time\" and \"space\" for learning with an emphasis on the  characteristics  of  children,  (2)  the  establishment  of  an  ecosystem  that  supports  Inquiry  Based  and STEAM education throughout society, and (3) the elimination of the divide between the humanities and sciences and the elimination of the gender gap in learning in science and mathematics. In particular, we will work with the cooperation of industry to promote initiatives to support study abroad at the high school and higher education levels throughout society, including the Tobitate! Study Abroad Initiative through public-private collaboration, and to build an ecosystem that provides diverse learning to children through the participation of companies, etc. The results of these initiatives will be fed back into the policy as needed along with the follow-up results of this package.\n\n## (Enhancement of Recurrent Education)\n\n- \u00b7 To respond to changes in the social and economic structure by relearning and continuing to learn, and to realize  an  environment  in  which  those  who  wish  for  it  to  be  able  to  receive  diverse  and  high-quality recurrent education. Therefore, in order to ensure that individual relearning is appropriately evaluated, the government will promote the visualization of learning histories, required abilities and learning, and the reflection  of  relearning  in  the  evaluation  and  treatment  of  companies,  and  will  continue  to  promote initiatives  such  as  the  construction  of  a  recurrent  education  model  through  an  industry-academia collaborative system.\n\n## (3) Creation of Innovation Ecosystem\n\n- \u00b7 In order to open up the excellent technological potential of universities and companies in cities and regions (local) on a global basis, and to continuously generate innovations that lead to new industries and social changes, it is essential to create a startup ecosystem that is equal to that of the world. We will strongly promote the creation of an innovation ecosystem so that highly creative human resources can jump into the path  of  entrepreneurship  without  hesitation  in  order  to  realize  the  creation  and  large-scale  growth  of startups  by  utilizing  new  technologies  (deep  tech)  derived  from  high-quality  basic  research,  with\n\nuniversities and other institutions serving as the source of innovation at the core.\n\n## \u2460 Thorough Support for R&amp;D-Startups\n\n(Enhancement of Support through the SBIR System)\n\n- \u00b7 With regard to the SBIR (Small/Startup Business Innovation Research) system, in April 2021, the rationale was transferred to the Act Concerning the Revitalization of Science, Technology and Innovation Creation (Act No. 63 of 2008), and the system was changed to focus on innovation creation with the Cabinet Office as the control tower. R&amp;D issues based on policy needs and government procurement needs will be set, and continuous support will continue to be provided through multi-level selection across ministries and agencies, supported by program managers. We will also continue to support the technology demonstration phase in the advanced technology field, which has been added since FY2023, and strongly promote social implementation by startups and others. In addition, with a view to responding to the \"valley of death\" caused by the shortage of R&amp;D funds at startups in the seed period (stage before receiving investment from venture capital firms (hereinafter referred to as \"VC\"), etc.), we will implement initiatives for collaboration among the three organizations: the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), and the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), based on the \"Basic Policy on Funding for R&amp;D Startups\" formulated in March 2024.\n\n## (Promoting Public Procurement from Startups)\n\n- \u00b7 To promote public procurement for startup development, it is important for government agencies to create a virtuous circle of \"knowing,\" \"seeing,\" and \"using\" new technologies of startups. Therefore, in order to solve administrative problems for which it is difficult for the government alone to find optimal solutions, the government will utilize a new flexible procurement mechanism that enables voluntary contracts for advanced  and  unique  new  technologies  of  startups  in  accordance  with  the  procurement  needs  of  the government.  In  addition,  we  will  promote  the  use  of  special  measures  for  eligibility  of  startups  to participate in bidding, which was expanded in FY2023, and special measures for voluntary contracts for companies using the SBIR system, as well as enhancing matching opportunities between startups and government agencies.\n\n## \u2461 Ecosystem Creation by Cities, Regions, Universities, and Startups\n\n(Accelerating the Realization of the Global Startup Campus (GSC) Initiative)\n\n- \u00b7 As a powerful driving engine for the Japanese economy, we will create a hub for the innovation ecosystem through cooperation with domestic and foreign startups.

Prior to the establishment of the hub, prior research and fellowships with innovative themes based on the ideas of outstanding young researchers will be launched. In addition, efforts by local governments nationwide to promote startups and cooperation with related private companies will be strengthened to promote structural reform of the innovation ecosystem throughout Japan. Furthermore, in order to improve its attractiveness as a hub for global networks, related measures will be accelerated to improve the stay environment for overseas researchers and the business environment for startups.\n\n## (Supporting Startup Ecosystem Hub Cities)\n\n- \u00b7 In addition to the utilization of the Global Acceleration Program, the ideal state of the next hub city will be considered by expanding the membership and area of each  hub city consortium, globalization, and promoting  co-creation  with  large  companies.  In  addition,  we  will  expand  the  programs  nationwide extending the maximum period of stay to two years, integrating the Project to Promote Foreign National Entrepreneurial  Activities  and  the  Project  for  Facilitation  of  Acceptance  of  Foreign  Entrepreneurs  in National Strategic Special Zones.\n\n## (Improving Intellectual Property Governance at University)\n\n- \u00b7 We will continue to promote publicity activities to disseminate the University IP Governance Guidelines to targeted universities nationwide through explanations at conferences and meetings related to industryacademia collaboration and improve university IP governance. In addition, we will exchange views on the Guidelines with major universities and other institutions nationwide and taking into account the  views received consider how to reflect them in policies.\n\n## (Human Resource Development as a Foundation for Startups)\n\n- \u00b7 We will steadily promote the 5-year 1,000-person dispatch program, expand efforts to develop young human resources through mentors, strengthen entrepreneurship education at the primary and secondary education levels, and provide opportunities for entrepreneurship education to all university students who wish to do so.\n\n## (Accelerating the Vision for a Digital Garden City Nation)\n\n- \u00b7 In  the  comprehensive  strategy  for  the  Vision  for  a  Digital  Garden  City  Nation  (Cabinet  decision  of December 23, 2022), smart cities have been positioned as a model regional vision, together with initiatives such as super cities and digital garden health special zones and have become a part of the Vision for a Digital Garden City Nation. Smart cities are required to move from the demonstration project stage to implementation, and measures will be steadily implemented based on the road map prepared in March 2024. In addition, based on the Package for Comprehensive Promotion of Research Universities with a Regional Core and Distinctive Characteristics, we  will promote Industry-Academia-Government Collaborations and open innovation with universities at its core, and contribute to the realization of the digital rural city-state concept by utilizing such groups as smart cities, startup ecosystem hub cities, and regional bio- communities.\n\n## \u2462 Promoting a virtuous cycle of human resources, technology, and funds\n\n- \u00b7 In order for \"technology and ideas\" to lead to \"creation of new value\" for products and services, etc., we will support R&amp;D at universities, etc. and the identifying and nurturing CxO and other management and innovation human resources, etc., and promote the mobilization of innovation resources (human resources, technology, equipment, funds, etc.) of large companies such as cross-border learning and carve-outs to startups.\n\n## (Formation of a Growth-Oriented Financial Cycle)\n\n- \u00b7 From the viewpoint of strengthening the supply of growth funds for startups, we will diversify the exit strategies  of  startups  by  focusing  on  sector-specific  support  such  as  deep  tech  and  drug  discovery, promoting the development of an environment for the introduction of fair value assessment in VC funds to encourage  institutional  investment,  increasing  the  investment  of  public  capital  to  stimulate  private\n\ninvestment, including investment by public and private funds such as the Organization for Small &amp; Medium Enterprises and Regional Innovation, JAPAN (SME Support, JAPAN) and Japan Investment Corporation (JIC),  and  promoting  the  use  of  an  open  innovation  promotion  tax  system,  as  well  as  promoting  the concentration of public and private sector support through J-Startup.\n\n## (Expanding R&amp;D Investment)\n\n- \u00b7 While a deflationary mindset prevailed in Japan during the 'lost 30 years,' many companies focused on cutting costs of existing businesses and investing overseas. While investment in science, technology and innovation continued to increase over time in other countries, investment in R&amp;D for new business creation in Japan remained almost flat.\n- \u00b7 In the Sixth STI Basic Plan, the government set a target of about 30 trillion yen in R&amp;D investment and about 120 trillion yen in R&amp;D investment by the public and private sectors over a period of five years, of which the government's R&amp;D investment reached about 32 trillion yen including the government budget for FY2024. Currently, firms' willingness for capital investment, which had been sluggish, is at its highest level since 1983, and the amount of private firms' capital investment is expected to be 104.8 trillion yen in FY2024. In addition, domestic investment in R&amp;D by private firms, which had been flat until now, finally picked up in FY2022, showing signs of expansion.\n- \u00b7 Wages that did not rise also showed their highest level in 30 years in the spring wage offensive, and wages have started to rise. In addition, the amount of funding raised by startups has increased about 10 times in the 10 years since 2013, and the number of M&amp;As is on the rise.\n- \u00b7 It is extremely important that the public and private sectors continue to make bold R&amp;D investments in cooperation with each other in order to survive fierce competition among countries with the awareness that now is the last chance to connect this 'turn of the tide' to continuous growth, and that the results of such investments be implemented and commercialized in society to lead to economic growth in Japan.\n\n(End)", "metadata": {"country": "Japan", "year": 2024, "legally_binding": "no", "binding_proof": NaN, "date": "NaT", "regulator": "Cabinet Office of Japan", "type": NaN, "status": "enacted", "language": "English", "use_cases": "[1,2,3,4,5,6]"}}

In addition, interactive generative AI has recently appeared leading to AI democratization, which has made it easy for many people to use AI for various purposes through dialogues. Therefore, companies have been making efforts to not only incorporate AI into their business processes but also reconstruct their business models themselves based on the values that will be created by AI. Some private individuals have also increased their efforts to apply their knowledge to AI and enhance their productivity. Japan has been promoting Society 5.0, a concept of a human-centric society in which both economic growth and solutions for social challenges are achieved through a system that merges the cyberspace and physical space in an advanced way, called a \"Cyber-Physical System\" (CPS). To embody this concept and enable the society to accept AI and use it appropriately, \"Social Principles of HumanCentric AI\" was established in March 2019. Meanwhile, risks have been increasing as the scope of use of AI technologies and the users have been increasing. Generative AI, especially, has incurred new societal risks that are not carried by conventional AI, such as infringements of intellectual property rights and generation and transmission of disinformation or misinformation, leading to the diversification and increase of societal risks resulting from AI.\n\nAgainst this background, the Guidelines present unified guiding principles in AI governance in Japan to promote safe and secure use of AI. It is intended to help people who use AI in various businesses to fully recognize AI risks based on international trends and stakeholders' concerns, and to voluntarily take the necessary countermeasures across the entire lifecycle. The Guidelines aim  to  actively  and  cooperatively  develop  a  framework  that  achieves  both  promotion  of innovation  and  reduction  of  risks  across  the  lifecycle  through  mutual  cooperation  among interested parties in implementing the common guiding principles, important matters for each AI business actor, and AI governance.\n\nJapan led discussions held at international forums, such as the G7, G20, and OECD, and made a lot of contributions, starting with the proposal for the AI R&amp;D Principles at the G7 ICT Ministers' Meeting  in Takamatsu,  Kagawa,  in April  2016.  Incidentally,  the  following  matters  have  been pointed out regarding the actual implementation of the principles in AI:\n\n- \uf09f AI use is viewed as a solution to some social challenges, such as decreasing labor caused by a declining birthrate and aging population.\n- \uf09f There is a time lag between formulation and enforcement of laws and the speed and complexity of AI technology development and social implementation.\n- \uf09f Rule-based regulations that stipulate detailed obligations might inhibit innovations.\n\nThus, it was decided to draw up guidelines on the basis of the goal-based concept that would lead to the achievement of purposes through soft laws without any legally binding force that would encourage interested parties to make voluntary efforts to reduce societal risks in AI and promote innovations and use of AI.\n\nOn  this  understanding,  the  \"Draft AI  R&amp;D  Guidelines  for  International  Discussions\"  and  \"AI Utilization Guidelines: Practical Reference for AI Utilization\" were established and announced on the initiative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, and \"Governance Guidelines for Implementation of AI Principles ver. 1.1\" were established and announced on the initiative of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. And this occasion, by integrating and modifying those three guidelines, the Guidelines (soft laws without any legally binding force) were newly established to help business operators cooperate to conduct social implementation of AI and governance in it, reflecting the features of AI technologies that had further advanced in recent years, and the domestic and international discussions about social implementation of AI. (See \"Figure 1. Positioning of the Guidelines.\") It is intended to help business operators (including\n\npublic  institutions  such  as  governments  and  municipalities)  who  use  AI  by  referring  to  the Guidelines instead of the existing guidelines to understand the guiding principles that lead to desirable actions for safe and secure use of AI. The Guidelines are established through studies conducted by multiple stakeholders that consisted of academic and research institutions, civil societies including general consumers, private sector companies, and the like, rather than having the government take the initiative alone, to prioritize effectiveness and validity.\n\nFigure 1. Positioning of the Guidelines\n\nThe use of AI might incur a great risk to society depending on the field and how it is used, and social disagreement caused by this risk might inhibit AI use itself. On the other hand, taking too many measures might inhibit AI use itself or decrease the benefits of using AI. Therefore, it's important to take a risk-based approach in which we estimate the level of risks (impact and probability of hazards) that can be entailed by how it is used in the applicable field beforehand, to ensure the degree of measures taken are appropriate to the level of risks. The Guidelines provide the guides to the measures to be taken by companies based on a risk-based approach. Note that the concept of a risk-based approach has been commonly adopted by countries with advanced AI.\n\nTrends in AI are constantly changing, so it is planned that the Guidelines will be updated as a living  document  as  needed,  also  in  response  to  international  discussions,  with  the  multiple stakeholder  engagement  while  reflecting  the  agile  governance  philosophy  to  continuously improve AI governance 1 . In such activities, it will be determined how the guiding principles and implementation  should  be  updated  as  the  countermeasures  against  risks  in  accordance  with maturity of AI in the society. (See \"Figure 2. Basic concepts of the Guidelines.\")\n\n1 The report is compiled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications' conference toward AI Network Society and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's Study Group on AI Business Guidelines. The review system will be determined and modified as appropriate in line with future circumstances.\n\nFigure 2. Basic concepts of the Guidelines\n\nThe  Guidelines  present  basic  concepts  regarding  efforts  necessary  for  the  development, provision, and use of AI. Therefore, for the actual development, provision, and use of AI, it is important  that  all  business  operators  who  intend  to  use AI  will  voluntarily  promote  specific efforts using the Guidelines as one of their references. At the same time, all business operators who intend to use AI should recognize the magnitude of AI's impact on society and be conscious of using it to develop human society better. It is important that the business operators pay close attention that if society considers the efforts to be inappropriate or insufficient, it might lead to  opportunity  losses  in  their  businesses  and  it  might  become  difficult  to  maintain  business values. Paying close attention to these possibilities enables to maximize the benefits from AI, strengthen competitiveness, and maintain and improve the business values. Incidentally, because the Guidelines contain reference information for AI use and risk information, it is also helpful for people who are not business operators relevant to AI, for example, staff of academic and research institutions and general consumers (including minors).\n\nThe Guidelines are intended for all AI business actors (including public institutions such as governments and municipalities) who develop, provide, or use AI in various businesses. On the other hand, the Guidelines are not intended for those who use AI for non-business activities and those who derive benefits from AI systems and services without directly using AI for business and, in  some  cases,  sustain  damage  (hereinafter,  both  are  referred  to  as  \"non-business  users\"). However, necessary points for those who develop, provide, or use AI for business purposes to serve non-business users are included in this guideline. Data is dispensable for AI to learn. Specific companies and individuals (hereinafter referred to as \"data providers\") who provide such data are  similarly  not  included  in  the  target  of  this  guideline.  This  guideline  assumes  those  who develop, provide or use AI are themselves responsible for those data as data holders.\n\nAs described above, the parties that the Guidelines are intended for are roughly grouped under \"AI  developers,\"  \"AI  providers,\"  and  \"AI  business  users\"  as AI  business  actors  who  conduct AI businesses  and  are  defined  herein.  It  is  assumed  that  these AI  business  actors  are  business operators (or departments of business operators), and a business operator might take on two or more roles as an AI developer, AI provider, and AI business user depending on the AI use method. (See \"Figure 3. Correlation between AI business actor and general AI use flow.\") 2\n\n## \uf09f AI developer\n\n2 Generative AI is included in the targets of the development, provision, and use of AI. If an AI provider or AI business user is a public institution, such as a government or municipality, a concept different from that for private business operators might be required.\n\nBusiness operators who develop AI systems (including business operators who research AI). They develop AI models as well as algorithms and contribute to construction of AI systems including AI models, base system, as well as I/O functions via data collection (including purchase), data preprocessing, training with data.\n\n## \uf09f AI provider\n\nBusiness  operators  who  incorporate AI  systems  into  applications,  products,  or  existing systems, business processes, etc., and provide them to AI business users and, in some cases, non-business users as services.\n\nThey verify AI systems, integrate AI systems with other systems, provide AI systems and services, offer operation support for AI business users on AI systems for normal operations, or perform the AI service operation itself. Communication with various stakeholders might be required during the provision of AI services.\n\n## \uf09f AI business user\n\nBusiness operators who use AI systems or AI services in their businesses.\n\nTheir role is to use an AI system or AI service in an appropriate way intended by the AI provider, share information such as environmental changes with the AI provider, continue the normal operation, operate the provided AI system as necessary. In addition, when nonbusiness  users  might  be  affected  by AI  use  in  some  ways 3   , AI  business  users  are  also responsible for making efforts to prevent AI from incurring unexpected disadvantages for those non-business users and maximize benefits from AI.\n\nFigure 3. Correlation between AI business actor and general AI use flow\n\n3 Non-business users need to pay close attention that they may suffer some type of damage if they do not follow the instructions and precautions from AI business users.\n\nIt is important that each party clarifies \"the efforts to be made regarding AI (guiding principles =  what)\"  based  on  \"the  ideal  society  while  considering  stakeholders'  expectations  (basic philosophies = why)\" from each relevant perspective (AI developer, AI provider, or AI business user). In addition, it is conceivable that studying, determining, and implementing \"the specific approach to be adopted (implementation = how)\" to fulfill the guiding principles are useful to use AI safely and securely. Actual AI systems and services can be used in various cases depending on the purpose, used technology, data, usage environment, etc. Therefore, it is important that AI  developers, AI  providers,  and AI  business  users  cooperate  with  each  other  to  devise  the optimum  approach  while  considering  changes  in  the  external  environment,  such  as  the advancement of technologies. For the sake of readability, the main part of the Guidelines covers the basic philosophies and guiding principles, and the appendix covers implementation.\n\nThe structure of the main part of the Guidelines, which covers the basic philosophies and guiding principles, is shown below:\n\n## \uf09f Part 1\n\nThis part mainly describes definitions of terms to help understand the Guidelines.\n\n## \uf09f Part 2\n\nThis part describes the society to aim for through AI use, the basic philosophies (why) and principles for realizing it, and the common guiding principles (what) among AI business actors. It also describes the establishment of governance required for implementing the common guiding principles considering the possibility of risks in AI to the society during the pursuit of benefits from AI use. Part 2 describes matters that form the base for Part 3 and  later  parts,  so  it  is  important  that  all  business  operators  who  use AI  read  it  and understand its descriptions.\n\n## \uf09f Parts 3 to 5\n\nThese parts describe the precautions for each of the three AI business actors who conduct businesses using AI that are not mentioned in Part 2. It is important that each business operator who uses AI understands the precautions relevant to itself. In addition, it is also important that each AI business actor understands the precautions for other AI business actors as well, because there are many matters relevant to adjacent AI business actors. (See \"Figure 4. Structure of the Guidelines.\")\n\nFigure 4. Structure of the Guidelines\n\nFor AI developers, AI providers, and AI business users, in addition to Parts 1 and 2, reading the corresponding part among Parts 3 to 5 and the appendix will help them understand risks in AI use and the basic concept of the policy for handling them. Because the examples described in the appendix are helpful as references for business operators who have not determined any specific efforts to make, it is important to chiefly read relevant contents in the appendix. For business executive officers 4 , including management, to fulfill their duties, it is important to consider and take countermeasures against risks in AI use together with the business strategy, in accordance with the basic philosophies (why) and guiding principles (what) described in the Guidelines to promote safe and secure AI use.\n\nThe environment surrounding AI is rapidly advancing worldwide, so it is important that business operators who intend to use AI pay attention to international trends. Under these circumstances, Japan took the initiative in establishing an international common understanding on AI and its guiding principles through the Hiroshima AI Process 5  and took on the key role in the development of the Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework in December 2023. The Guidelines are also intended to contribute to the Process and have been established taking into account international discussions including the Process. On the other hand, the policies and rules for AI vary with country and region, so business operators who perform cross-border activities should obey local laws and fulfill stakeholders' expectations. As for advanced AI systems, especially, some countries and regions take some measures to assure effective AI governance, for example,\n\n4 Business executive officers include those in public institutions such as governments and municipalities.\n\n5 Based on the result of the G7 Hiroshima Summit held in May 2023, the Hiroshima AI Process was initiated to study international rules concerning generative AI. After that, the G7 Digital &amp; Tech Minister Meeting was held in December 2023 based on the \"G7 Leaders' Statement on the Hiroshima AI Process\" announced after the Hiroshima AI Process Minister-level Meeting in September 2023 and the Multi-stakeholder High-level Meeting at Kyoto IGF in October. As the achievements of 2023, the \"Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework\" and \"Work Plan to advance Hiroshima AI Process\" were formulated. https://www.soumu.go.jp/hiroshimaaiprocess/\n\nestablishing a safety framework of AI validation prior to their release to the market 6 , so it is important to pay attention to them.\n\n6  In November 2023, the UK announced a plan for founding the AI Safety Institute that would develop and perform evaluations of advanced AI systems. The US announced that it would establish the US AI Safety Institute in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to implement an AI risk management framework and evaluate red teaming. Japan is also planning to found the AI Safety Institute in the Information-technology Promotion Agency(IPA) on February 14 th , 2024 in cooperation with the  Cabinet  Office  and  relevant  Ministries  and Agencies  with  the  purpose  of  discussion  of  standards,  guidance,  etc.  that contribute  to  improving  the  safety  of  AI  development,  provision,  and  use,  research  on  AI  safety  evaluation  methods, technologies and cases related to AI safety, etc. in collaboration with overseas institutes mentioned above.\n\n## Part 1 Definitions\n\nThe  term  \"AI,\"  which  means Artificial  Intelligence,  is  said  to  first  used  at  the  Dartmouth Conference in 1956 for the first time. Although there is no agreed definition of AI, as implied from the fact that it is the abbreviation of \"Artificial\" and \"Intelligence,\" it refers to a computer program that works in a similar way to human's thinking process and a system that can make intelligent decisions on a computer. In the past, some systems called \"expert systems,\" which make  inferences  from  a  large  amount  of  knowledge  data  that  is  input  based  on  experts' knowledge without machine learning (ML), were considered as a type of AI.\n\nHowever, in 2000s and later, deep learning emerged, and they used it for image recognition, natural  language  processing  (including  translation),  and  speech  recognition  with  machine learning. And systems able to predict, propose or make decisions in specific areas are now called AI.  In  addition,  since  2021,  foundation  models 7    have  appeared,  prompting  developments  of general-purpose AI, which is different from AI that specializes in a specific field. That led to not only predictions, recommendations and decision making but also emergence of 'generative AI' of images, sentences and etc., which attracts attention of society as a whole. As described above, there are many different types of AI, and it is difficult for even experts to predict the future of AI technologies.\n\nWith these circumstances, related terms in the Guidelines are defined as follows.\n\n## Related terms\n\n## \uf09f AI\n\nNo agreed definition has been existed as of now (\"Social Principles of Human-Centric AI\" formulated by the Integrated Innovation Strategy Promotion Council on March 29, 2019), and  it  is  difficult  to  strictly  define  artificial  intelligence  in  a  broad  sense.  AI  in  the Guidelines is an abstract concept, which includes AI systems (defined below) themselves or software or programs that perform machine learning.\n\n(For reference, it is defined in JIS X 22989:2023 based on ISO/IEC 22989:2022 as follows.) &lt;Academic discipline&gt; Research and development of mechanisms and applications of AI systems\n\nNote 1: Research and development can be conducted in several fields, including computer science, data science, natural science, human science, and mathematics.\n\n## \uf09f AI system\n\nA system (such as a machine, robot, and cloud system) that works at various levels of autonomy during the use process and incorporates a software element that has a learning function.\n\n(For reference, it is defined in JIS X 22989:2023 based on ISO/IEC 22989:2022 as follows.) An engineering system that produces outputs such as contents, predictions, recommendations, and decision-makings in response to a given set of goals defined by humans.\n\nNote 1: As for an engineering system, models that represent data, knowledge, processes, etc., that can be used to perform tasks can be developed using various techniques and approaches relevant to artificial intelligence.\n\nNote 2: An AI system is designed to work at various autonomous levels.\n\n(For reference, it is defined in the OECD AI Principles overview as follows.)\n\nAn AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, makes inferences.  It  generates  outputs  including  predictions,  contents,  recommendations,\n\n7 Fundamental models typified by large language models are core technological foundations for creating individual models that support various services. They have characteristics different from general AI from the viewpoints of development of models adapted  to  a  broad  range  of  downstream  tasks  derived  from  a  fundamental  model  and  knowledge  acquired  through  the development process itself.\n\ndecisions and so on to place impact on physical or virtual environments from received data.  Different  AI  systems  vary  in  their  levels  of  autonomy  and  adaptiveness  after deployment.\n\n## \uf09f Advanced AI system\n\nThe  most  advanced  AI  systems  including  the  cutting-edge  foundation  models  and generative AI systems.\n\n(Quoted from the definition in the Hiroshima AI Process)\n\n## \uf09f AI model (ML model)\n\nA  model  incorporated  into  an AI  system  and  acquired  through  machine  learning  using training data. It produces prediction results in accordance with the input data. (For reference, it is defined in JIS X 22989:2023 based on ISO/IEC 22989:2022 as follows.) A mathematical structure that produces inferences or predictions based on input data or information.\n\nExample:  When  a  univariate  linear  function  y  = \u03b8 0 +  \u03b8 1x  is  trained  using  the  linear regression, the result model is y = 3 + 7x or the like.\n\nNote 1: A machine learning model is acquired as a result of training based on a machine learning algorithm.\n\n## \uf09f AI service\n\nA  service  that  uses AI  systems.  It  refers  to  providing AI  business  users  with  values  in general.  AI  services  are  provided  and  operated  through  not  only  technologies  that constitute an AI system, but also non-technological approaches, including monitoring by humans and appropriate communications with stakeholders.\n\n## \uf09f Generative AI\n\nA  general  term  representing AI  developed  from  an AI  model  that  can  generate  texts, images, programs, etc.\n\n## \uf09f AI governance\n\nThe  design  and  operation  of  technological,  organizational,  and  social  systems  by stakeholders for the purpose of managing risks posed by the use of AI at levels acceptable to stakeholders and maximizing their positive impact (benefit).\n\n## Part 2 Society to aim for with AI, and matters each AI business actor works on\n\nPart 2 describes \"A. Basic philosophies\" as the society to aim for with AI first. Next, it describes \"B. Principles\" at which each AI business actor works on to realize the basic philosophies and \"C. Common Guiding Principles\" that are derived from the principles. Furthermore, it describes \"D. Common Guiding Principles for AI Business actors involved in advanced AI systems,\" which should be followed by business operators involved in advanced AI systems. After that, it describes \"E. Building AI  governance,\"  which  is  important  for  the  implementation  of  \"C.  Common  guiding principles\" and safe and secure use of AI.\n\n## A. Basic philosophies\n\nAs described in the \"Preface,\" \"Social Principles of Human-Centric AI\" formulated by Japan in March 2019 states that it  is  expected  that AI will  contribute  to  the  creation  of  Society  5.0. Additionally, the document states that it is important to use AI as a public asset of humans that can lead to the achievement of global sustainability through qualitative changes of the ideal society as well as true innovations. The document also states that the following three values should  be  respected  as  basic  philosophies  in  order  to  build  a  society  that  upholds  such philosophies.\n\n## (1) Dignity: A society that has respect for human dignity\n\nRather than building a society  in  which  effectiveness  and  convenience  are  pursued through AI use to the point that humans become excessively dependent on AI and AI is used to control human behaviors, it is necessary to build a society that has respect for human dignity and for humans to take full advantage of AI as a tool to fully demonstrate their various capabilities. This will allow them to exert more creativity or engage in more challenging jobs and live physically and mentally rich lives.\n\n## (2) Diversity &amp; Inclusion: A society where people with diverse backgrounds can pursue their own well-being\n\nOne of the present-day ideals and big challenges is the creation of a society in which people with diverse backgrounds, values, or ways of thinking can seek different wellbeing, so they can be flexibly included and new values can be created. Powerful AI technologies can be an effective tool for approaching this ideal. We need to transform the state of society as described above through proper development and deployment of AI.\n\n## (3) Sustainability: A sustainable society\n\nWe need to use AI to bring new businesses and solutions into the world one after another to build a sustainable society that can eliminate social disparities and address global environmental problems and climate changes. As a science-and-technology-oriented country, Japan has a responsibility to contribute to the creation of such a society by using  AI  to  strengthen  its  accumulated  scientific  and  technological  expertise  and knowledge.\n\nFigure 5. Basic philosophies\n\nThese  fundamental  concepts  remain  goals  for  us  to  achieve  and  do  not  change  despite significant technological evolution. Therefore, these basic philosophies should be respected as objectives to achieve through domestic and international frameworks as AI evolves.\n\n## B. Principles\n\nTo realize the basic philosophies, it is important that each AI business actor makes efforts to comply with the philosophies. Therefore, we categorized the principles that should be kept in mind by each AI business actor into the activities to be implemented by each AI business actor and the activities expected to be implemented in cooperation with society. These principles have been  formulated by  restructuring  \"Social  Principles  of  Human-Centric AI\"  in  accordance  with overseas principles, including OECD's AI principles.\n\n## Activities to be implemented by each AI business actor\n\nIt is important that each AI business actor achieves its purposes of AI, such as creating business value and solving social challenges, while promoting the development, provision, or use of AI systems  and  services  and  maintaining  human  dignity,  based  on  the  human-centric 8    concept derived from the basic philosophies. To accomplish this, it is important that each AI business actor ensures values, such as safety and fairness, to reduce societal risks arising from AI use. In addition,  it  is  important  to  protect  privacy including  the  prevention of  inappropriate  use  of personal data and ensure security against risks such as a decreasing availability and external attack caused by vulnerabilities of AI systems. To achieve these goals, it is important that each AI  business actor ensures the verifiability of systems and improves transparency by providing appropriate information to stakeholders 9  and ensures accountability.\n\nIn consideration of the possibility of the roles of AI business actors changing due to value chain changes caused by the diversification of AI architectures, it is important that AI business actors cooperate with each other to make efforts to improve the quality of AI in the entire value chain and continue discussions among multiple stakeholders.\n\nBy making these efforts, each AI business actor is expected to derive maximum benefit from the development, provision, or use of AI systems and services while minimizing the AI risks.\n\n8 The underlined parts are organized as \"C. Common Guiding Principles\" in the latter part.\n\n9 Stakeholder: All the AI business actors who might be directly or indirectly affected by AI use including third parties other than AI developers, AI providers, AI business users, and non-business users. (The same shall apply hereafter.)\n\n## Activities expected to be implemented in cooperation with society\n\nIn order to enhance benefits from AI for the society and realize the basic philosophies that we should  pursue,  each AI  business  actor  is  expected  to  actively  collaborate  with  the  society, including the governments, municipalities, and communities, as well as individually commit to its own activities. To accomplish this, each AI business actor is expected to provide opportunities for ensuring education and literacy in cooperation with the society to avoid divisions within the society and spread the benefits from AI to all of the people. In addition to that, each AI business actor is expected to contribute to activities that ensure fair competition and facilitate innovation that can create new businesses and services, maintain sustainable economic growth, and provide solutions for social challenges.\n\n## C. Common Guiding Principles\n\nIn the activities, each AI business actor should develop, provide, or use AI systems and services respecting the rule of law, human rights, democracy, diversity, and fair and just society in light of \"1) Human-centric\" described below. In addition, relevant laws, including the Constitution of Japan, Intellectual Property Basic Act and relevant laws, and Act on the Protection of Personal Information as well as existing laws and regulations in individual fields pertaining to AI should be observed, and it is important to pay close attention to the circumstances of the drafting of international guiding principles 10,16 .\n\nIt is important that each AI business actors understand characteristics, intended use, purposes and social context of AI systems/services and positively process these activities with limited resources.\n\n## 1) Human-Centric\n\nWhen developing, providing, or using an AI system or service, each AI business actor should act in a way that does not violate the human rights guaranteed by the Constitution of Japan or granted internationally, as the foundation for accomplishing all matters to be conducted, including the matters described later. In addition, it is important that each AI business actor acts so that the AI expands human abilities and enables diverse people to seek diverse wellbeing.\n\n## (1) Human dignity and autonomy of individuals\n\n- \uf0b2 Based on the social context of AI use, respect human dignity and the autonomy of individuals.\n- \uf0b2 In  particular ,  when  linking AI  with  someone's brain or body, refer to discussions about  bioethics  in  foreign  countries  and  research  institutions,  together  with information of peripheral technologies.\n- \uf0b2 When profiling using AI in a field where personal rights and benefits can be severely affected,  use  AI  respecting  the  dignity  of  individuals,  maintaining  the  utmost accuracy of the outputs, understanding limitations of predictions, recommendations,  and  judgments  of  AI,  and  carefully  considering  possible drawbacks, and do not use it for inappropriate purposes.\n\n## (2) Paying attention to manipulations by AI on decision-makings and emotions\n\n10 Governing laws should be obeyed in accordance with the geographic business deployment status, locations of the AI providers and AI business users of the developed AI models, the locations of the servers to be used for training and the like. When you are required to comply with Japanese laws, handle personal data, intellectual property rights, and such like in compliance with their respective applicable laws in accordance with the data type. As for the handling of data, note that the use of some data might be prohibited by a contract between stakeholders, even when it is not stipulated by laws.\n\n- \uf0b2 Do  not  develop,  provide,  or  use  AI  systems  and  services  with  purpose  of manipulating human decision making, recognition and emotion or on the premise of unconscious control.\n- \uf0b2 When developing, providing, or using an AI system or service, pay attention and take necessary countermeasures against the risk of heavy dependence on AI, such as automated biases 11 .\n- \uf0b2 Pay  attention  to AI  use  that  might  instigate  biased  information  or  values  and unwillingly limit the options that should be originally available to people including AI business users, such as a filter bubble 12 .\n- \uf0b2 Carefully handle AI outputs, especially when they can be relevant to procedures that might significantly affect the society, such as an election and decision-making in a community.\n\n## (3) Countermeasures against disinformation, etc.\n\n- \uf0b2 Generative AI has enabled everyone to forge fake information that seems to be true and fair, so recognize the increasing risk of destabilizing and confusing the society through disinformation, misinformation, and biased information generated by AI, and take necessary countermeasures 13 .\n\n## (4) Ensuring diversity/inclusion\n\n- \uf0b2 In addition to ensuring fairness, to prevent information poverty and digital poverty and allow more people to enjoy the benefits of AI, pay attention to make it easy for socially vulnerable people to use AI.\n- \uf06c Adopt universal design, ensure accessibility, and provide relevant stakeholders 14  with education and support.\n\n## (5) Providing user support\n\n- \uf0b2 Offer rational information about the functions and peripheral technologies of the AI system or service, and allow users to use functions that timely and appropriately offer the information for judging choices.\n- \uf06c For example, default settings, provision of understandable options, provision of feedbacks, alerts in an emergency, and handling of errors.\n\n## (6) Ensuring sustainability\n\n- \uf0b2 Examine the impact of the whole lifecycle on the global environment during the development, provision, and use of AI systems and services.\n\nEach AI  business  actor  is  expected  to  consider  these  matters  as  preconditions  and  to enhance the performance (usefulness) of AI as much as possible to provide people with benefits and richness and achieve well-being.\n\n11  Refers to a phenomenon in which automated systems or technologies are excessively trusted or depended on when humans make judgments and decisions.\n\n12 A filter bubble refers to an information environment where an algorithm analyzes and learns about search histories and click histories of individual Internet users to preferentially show information they like, regardless of whether or not they want it to do so, separating them from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, and consequently, isolating them in a \"bubble\" of their own ways of thinking and values. In addition to a filter bubble, an echo chamber is also mentioned as one of the phenomena that are said to be caused by the interaction between the intrinsic human tendency and the characteristics of Internet media. While there are risks described above, AI also has a benefit that provides personalized and filtered answers to AI business users and non-business users enabling to offer proposals in a beneficial manner.\n\n13 The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will discuss ways for appropriate information distribution in the digital space,  including countermeasures to disinformation and misinformation on the Internet. They discuss them in institutional aspects, as well as various rights and interests such as freedom of expression. A thoughtful and comprehensive study has been carried out, and a report is scheduled to be compiled around the summer of 2024, so the status of these studies should be kept in mind.\n\n(Japanese Only) https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/kenkyu/digital_space/index.html\n\nRelevant stakeholder: The AI business actors who are directly or indirectly  involved  in AI use including AI developers, AI\n\n14 providers, AI business users, and non-business users. (The same shall apply hereafter.)\n\n## 2) Safety\n\nEach AI business actor should avoid damage to the lives, bodies, minds, and properties of stakeholders  during  the  development,  provision,  and  use  of AI  systems  and  services.  In addition, it is important that the environment is not damaged.\n\n## (1) Taking into consideration the lives, bodies, properties and minds of humans and the environment\n\n- \uf0b2 Ensure  that  the  AI  system/service  is  sufficiently  fulfilling  the  requirements, including the accuracy of outputs (reliability).\n- \uf0b2 Ensure that the performance level is maintained under various circumstances, and that grossly incorrect judgments are not made for irrelevant events (robustness).\n- \uf0b2 Ensure  controllability  that  allows  humans  to  control  AI  as  necessary  including objective  monitoring  and  handling,  in  accordance  with  the  characteristics  and purposes  of  the  relevant  AI,  in  light  of  the  severity  and  possibility  of  rights violations that can result from AI use or unintended AI behaviors.\n- \uf0b2 Conduct appropriate risk analyses to take countermeasures against risks (avoidance, mitigation, transference, or acceptance).\n- \uf0b2 If there are potential hazards to the lives, bodies, properties, and minds of humans and the environment, organize measures to be taken in advance and offer related information to stakeholders.\n- \uf06c Clearly specify measures that should be taken by relevant stakeholders and the terms of use.\n- \uf0b2 Determine the responses for cases where the safety of AI systems or services is endangered so that the steps can be quickly taken in such cases.\n\n## (2) Proper use (of AI)\n\n- \uf0b2 Develop, provide, or use AI systems and services within the range in which the AI business  actor  can  control,  preventing  damage  due  to  a  provision  or  use  that deviates from the intended purpose.\n\n## (3) Proper training 15\n\n- \uf0b2 In accordance with the characteristics and purposes of AI systems and services, ensure the accuracy, and recency as necessary, of the data (appropriateness of the data) to be used for training.\n- \uf0b2 Properly take actions such as the securement of transparency of data used for training, compliance with the legal framework 16 , and update of AI models, within reasonable extent.\n\n## 3) Fairness\n\nDuring the development, provision, or use of an AI system or service, it is important that each AI business actor makes efforts to eliminate unfair and harmful bias and discrimination against  any  specific  individuals  or  groups  based  on  race,  gender ,  national  origin,  age, political  opinion,  religion,  and  so  forth.  It  is  also  important  that  before  developing, providing, or using an AI system or service, each AI business actor recognizes that there are some  unavoidable  biases  even  if  such  attention  is  paid,  and  determines  whether  the\n\n15 It is important that AI providers and AI business users, in addition to AI developers, also make efforts to ensure safety if they make adjustments or conduct re-trainings.\n\n16 As for the relationship with the laws with regard to intellectual properties, discussions are in progress in the Intellectual Property Strategy Promotion Office under the Cabinet Office and the Agency for Cultural Affairs, so pay close attention to the consideration status in the future. As for the relationship between AI and copyrights, especially, the Legal System Subcommittee of the Copyright Subdivision of the Culture Council is arranging their discussions, so it is important that each AI business actor understands the intent of these discussions.\n\n\u30fb Intellectual Property Strategy Promotion Office under the Cabinet Office (Japanese Only)\n\nhttps://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/titeki2/index.html\n\n\u30fb Legal System Subcommittee of the Copyright Subdivision of the Culture Council(Japanese Only)\n\nhttps://www.bunka.go.jp/seisaku/bunkashingikai/chosakuken/hoseido/\n\nunavoidable  biases  are  allowable  from  the  viewpoints  of  respect  for  human  rights  and diverse cultures.\n\n## (1) Consideration for bias in technologies forming AI models\n\n- \uf0b2 There are a broad range of factors that can produce an inappropriate bias, so identify the factors that might produce biases that can be considered as problems from the viewpoint of fairness. Those factors may include technological elements (training data, AI model training process, prompts entered by AI business users or non-business  users 17  ,  and  reference  information  and  collaborating  external services used by AI models for inference) and behaviors of AI business users.\n- \uf0b2 Study the possibility that potential biases might be produced depending on the characteristics and purposes of the AI system or service.\n\n## (2) Intervention by decisions made by humans\n\n- \uf0b2 To prevent AI from generating unfair results, consider implementing timely human interventions, rather than letting AI make the decisions alone.\n- \uf0b2 Introduce  a  process  for  analyzing  and  handling  the  purposes,  restrictions, requirements,  and  decisions  for  the  AI  system  or  service  through  clear  and transparent methods, to see whether any biases have been produced.\n- \uf0b2 Be  careful  of  unconscious  biases  and  potential  biases,  and  communicate  with stakeholders from various backgrounds including culture or speciality for direction.\n\n## 4) Privacy protection\n\nIt is important that during the development, provision, or use of an AI system or service, each AI business actor respects and protects privacy in accordance with its importance. At this time, relevant laws should be obeyed.\n\n## (1) Protection of privacy across AI systems and services in general\n\n- \uf0b2 Observe relevant laws, including the Act on the Protection of Personal Information, and formulate and announce the privacy policy of each AI business actor, to take measures to respect and protect the privacy of stakeholders, in accordance with its importance, based on the social contexts and legitimate expectations of people.\n- \uf0b2 Consider measures for privacy protection while taking into account the following matters:\n- \uf06c Ensure measures based on the Act on the Protection of Personal Information.\n- \uf06c Refer to international principles and standards for personal data protection. 18\n\n## 5) Ensuring security\n\nDuring the development, provision, or use of an AI system or service, it is important that each  AI  business  actor  ensures  security  to  prevent  the  behaviors  of  AI  from  being unintentionally altered or stopped by unauthorized manipulations.\n\n## (1) Security measures relevant to AI systems and services 19\n\n17 AI business users can train generative AI, including large-scale language models, for a specific task using a training method called  in-context  learning  without  updating  the  learned  parameters  in  accordance  with  AI  business  users'  inputs  (called prompts).\n\n18 AI business actors are expected to follow international guiding principles on privacy, including \"OECD, Recommendation of the Council concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data, OECD/LEGAL/0188\" and \"ISO/IEC 29100:2011 Information technology Security techniques Privacy framework.\" In addition, the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) Forum has been established with the purpose of promoting the smooth cross-border transfer of personal data and the interoperability of regulations in countries across a broader range, and Japan joined it in April 2022 and has announced the Global CBPR Framework. As for generative AI, refer to the \"Statement on Generative AI\" by the G7 Data Protection and Privacy Authorities Roundtable (June 2023) and the \"Resolution on Generative Artificial Intelligence Systems\" by the Global Privacy Assembly (GPA) (October 2023) as well.\n\n19  For details on methods, refer to the \"Guidelines for secure AI system development\" (November 2023) by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of the UK as well.\n\n- \uf0b2 To maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of AI systems and services and ensure safe and secure AI use constantly, take reasonable measures based on the technological level at the time.\n- \uf0b2 Understand the characteristics of AI systems and services, and examine whether the  inter-system  connections  necessary  for  normal  operations  are  properly established.\n- \uf0b2 Bearing in mind that relevant stakeholders might make unexpected judgments by mixing detailed information into inference target data, recognize that vulnerabilities cannot be completely eliminated from AI systems and services.\n\n## (2) Consideration for the latest trends\n\n- \uf0b2 New methods for attacking AI systems and services from the outside are increasing on a daily basis. In order to address those risks, check the matters to be noted.\n\n## 6) Transparency 20\n\nWhen developing, providing, or using an AI system or service, based on the social context when the AI system or service is used, it is important that each AI business actor provides stakeholders with information to the reasonable extent necessary and technically possible while ensuring the verifiability of the AI system or service.\n\n## (1) Ensuring verifiability\n\n- \uf0b2 In order to ensure verifiability relating to decisions made by AI, record or store logs of AI training processes, inference processes, rationales of decisions made by AI, and the like (for example, input/output generated when developing and using the AI system or service) to the extent possible based on the data amount or contents.\n- \uf0b2 Discuss method, frequency, maintenance period and so on recordings of data logs, taking into account the importance for identifying causes of accidents, devising preventive measures, or proving requirements for responsibilities for damages, in accordance with characteristic of used technology as well as purposes.\n\n## (2) Providing relevant stakeholders with information\n\n- \uf0b2 Based on the relations with AI and the nature and purpose of AI, provide and explain information summarizing the items listed below according to the knowledge and ability of each stakeholder.\n- \uf06c AI systems and services in general\n- \uf0d8 Fact that AI is used and its scope\n- \uf0d8 Methods for data collection and annotation\n- \uf0d8 Methods for training and evaluation\n- \uf0d8 Information on the underlying AI models\n- \uf0d8 Capabilities and limitations of the AI system or service, and proper/improper use by AI business users\n- \uf0d8 Relevant laws applicable in the country/region where those provided with the AI system or service or AI business users are located\n- \uf0b2 Encourage  a  variety  of  stakeholders  to  engage  actively  through  dialogues  and collect various opinions on social impacts and safety.\n- \uf0b2 In addition, show actual advantages of providing or using the AI system or service and risks to relevant stakeholders.\n\n20 Various  countries  define  transparency  in  different  ways.  For  example,  the  \"Artificial  Intelligence  Risk  Management Framework\" by NIST (January 2023) defines it in three categories for AI: transparency (which can answer the question of \"what happened\" in the system), explainability (which can answer the question of \"how\" a decision was made in the system), and interpretability (which can answer the question of \"why\" a decision was made by the system and its meaning or context to the user), while the \"ETHICS GUIDELINES FOR TRUSTWORTHY AI\" by the European Commission (April 2019) defines it as traceability, explainability, and communication. The international standard ISO/IEC JTC1/SC42 defines the transparency as the degree to which appropriate  information about  the AI  system  is  communicated  to  relevant  stakeholders.  In  this  document,  matters relating to information disclosure are broadly referred to as \"transparency.\"\n\n## (3) Reasonable and truthful support\n\n- \uf0b2 Provision of information to stakeholders described above \"(2) Providing relevant stakeholders with information\" doesn't assume disclosure of algorithms or source code, but it assumes providing them to the extent that satisfies social rationality based on the characteristics  and  uses of  the  technologies  to be  adopted  while respecting privacy and trade secrets.\n- \uf0b2 If any open technologies are used, conform to the rules specified for them.\n- \uf0b2 When disclose developed AI systems as open source, consider any potential social impacts.\n\n## (4) Improving explainability and interpretability for relevant stakeholders\n\n- \uf0b2 Share necessary explanations for those to be explained with actors who explain to analyze requirements of such explanation to gain relevant stakeholders' understanding and sense of safety to provide proof of AI operations.\n- \uf06c AI  provider:  Inform  the AI  developer  about  things  that  are  required  to  be explained.\n- \uf06c AI business user: Inform the AI developer and AI provider about things that are required to be explained.\n\n## 7) Accountability 21\n\nWhen developing, providing, or using an AI system or service, it is important that each AI business  actor  executes  its  accountability  to  stakeholders  within  reasonable  extent  for ensuring traceability, conforming to common guiding principles, and the like based on each AI business actor's roles and the degree of risks posed by the AI system or service.\n\n## (1) Improving traceability\n\n- \uf0b2 Establish a situation that allows the origin of data and decisions made during the development, provision, or use of the AI system or service to be traced forward and backward to the extent that is reasonable and technically possible.\n\n## (2) Explanation of conformity to common guiding principles\n\n- \uf0b2 Provide and explain information on how AI business actors conform to common guiding principles regularly to stakeholders, including suppliers, according to their knowledge  and  competence.  This  information  summarizes,  for  example,  the following items:\n\n## \uf06c General\n\n- \uf0d8 Whether any risk is found that prevents the common guiding principles from being implemented, to what extent it prevents the implementation of those guiding principles\n- \uf0d8 Implementation progress of the common guiding principles\n\n## \uf06c Human-centric\n\n- \uf0d8 How  disinformation  is  considered,  and  how  diversity,  inclusion,  user support, and sustainability are ensured\n- \uf06c Safety\n- \uf0d8 Known risks relating to AI systems and services, countermeasures against them, and how to ensure safety against them\n\n## \uf06c Fairness\n\n- \uf0d8 Possibility that technological elements forming AI models will introduce bias.  Those  elements  may  include  training  data,  AI  model  training process, prompts expected to be entered by AI business users or non-\n\n21 While accountability is sometimes defined as explainability, the Guidelines handle information disclosure in the context of transparency,  so  accountability  is  defined  as  the  concept  of  taking  actual  and  legal  responsibilities  for  AI  and  setting prerequisites for taking the responsibilities.\n\nbusiness  users,  and  reference  information  and  collaborating  external services used by AI models for inference.\n\n## \uf06c Privacy protection\n\n- \uf0d8 Risks  of  infringements  of privacy  of AI  business  actors  or stakeholders entailed by the AI system or service, countermeasures against those risks, and  actions  expected  to  be  taken  when  the  privacy  breach  actually occurred.\n\n## \uf06c Ensuring security\n\n- \uf0d8 Conformity to standards required to facilitate collaboration between AI systems and services or with other systems if such collaboration occurs\n- \uf0d8 Any risks that may occur when the AI system or service collaborates with other AI systems and services via the Internet, and measures to be taken against the risks\n\n## (3) Designation of responsible persons\n\n- \uf0b2 Appoint someone as the person responsible for executing its accountability in each AI business actor.\n\n## (4) Sharing responsibilities among actors\n\n- \uf0b2 As for responsibilities shared among actors, clarify who take the responsibilities through contracts or social  promises  (voluntary  commitments) between  AI business actors including non-business users.\n\n## (5) Specific actions for stakeholders\n\n- \uf0b2 As necessary, establish and publicly report policies, including those created by each AI business actor on AI governance or privacy in relation to risk management or safety assurance associated with the use of AI systems and services. Those policies involve  social  responsibilities, including  sharing visions  with  and  giving out  and providing information to society and general citizens.\n- \uf0b2 As  necessary,  set  opportunities  for  accepting  comments  from  stakeholders  on incorrect AI output and the like, and conduct objective monitoring of the output.\n- \uf0b2 Set policies to handle cases that might affect the interests of stakeholders. Execute those  policies  reliably  and  report  the  progress  regularly  to  the  stakeholders  as necessary.\n\n## (6) Documentation 22\n\n- \uf0b2 Document and store information on the items described above and keep them available for a prescribed period whenever and wherever required and able to be referenced in a manner appropriate for their use.\n\nThe specific activities expected to be implemented by each AI business actor in cooperation with society are organized as follows.\n\n## 8) Education/literacy\n\nEach AI business actor is expected to provide the persons engaged in AI in the AI business actor with the necessary education to gain the knowledge, literacy, and ethical views to correctly understand and use AI in a socially correct manner. Each AI business actor is also expected to provide stakeholders with education, in consideration of the characteristics of AI, including its complexity and the misinformation that it may provide, and possibilities of\n\n22 Regarding \"documentation,\" there is no problem as long as records are kept using appropriate tools so that they can be easily confirmed later, and they do not necessarily need to be recorded in the paper or specific document.\n\n## intentional misuse of AI. 23\n\n## (1) Ensuring AI literacy\n\n- \uf0b2 Take  the  necessary  steps  to  ensure  that  the  persons  engaged  in AI  in  each AI business actor acquire AI literacy of the level sufficient for the engagement.\n\n## (2) Education and reskilling\n\n- \uf0b2 It is assumed that the division of tasks between AI and humans will change due to the  expansion  of  generative  AI  use,  so  discuss  actively  about  education  and reskilling to promote new ways of working.\n- \uf0b2 Provide  educational  opportunities  taking into  account  differences in  knowledge and  skills  among  generations  so  that  various  people  can  acquire  a  deeper understanding of benefits of AI and enhance the resilience against risks.\n\n## (3) Support for stakeholders\n\n- \uf0b2 To improve the safety of the whole AI system or AI service, provide stakeholders with education and literacy advancement as necessary.\n\n## 9) Ensuring fair competition\n\nEach  AI  business  actor  is  expected  to  maintain  the  fair  competitive  environment surrounding AI so that new businesses and services using AI are created, the sustainable economic growth is maintained, and solutions for social challenges are provided.\n\n## 10) Innovation\n\nEach AI business actor is expected to make efforts to actively contribute to the promotion of innovation for the whole society.\n\n## (1) Promoting open innovation, etc.\n\n- \uf0b2 Promote internationalization, diversification, collaboration among industry, academia, and government sectors, and open innovation.\n- \uf0b2 Make efforts to maintain the environment in which data necessary for AI innovation is created.\n\n## (2) Consideration for interconnectivity and interoperability\n\n- \uf0b2 Ensure the interconnectivity and interoperability between your AI systems/services and other AI systems/services.\n- \uf0b2 When there are standard specifications, comply with them.\n\n## (3) Providing information appropriately\n\n- \uf0b2 Provide necessary information to the extent that does not hinder the innovation of the information provider.\n\nIn addition to the matters described above, important matters for AI developers, AI providers or AI  business  users,  respectively,  are  organized  in  \"Table  1.  Important  matters  for  each AI\n\n23 The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and IPA published \"Digital Skill Standards\" (December 2022) that organized the profile of ideal human resources needed in the DX era as a guiding principle on personal studies and recruitment and education of human resources in companies. In addition, to further promote DX in companies through the use of generative AI, they compiled \"Concept of Human Resources and Skills Needed to Promote DX in Generative AI Era\" in August 2023 and added the necessity for the familiarity with directions (prompts) and capabilities to put queries and build up and verify hypotheses to the skill standards.\n\n\u30fb Digital Skill Standards(Japanese Only)\n\nhttps://www.meti.go.jp/policy/it_policy/jinzai/skill_standard/main.html\n\n\u30fb Study group on human resources policy in the digital age (Japanese Only)\n\nhttps://www.meti.go.jp/shingikai/mono_info_service/digital_jinzai/index.html\n\nbusiness actor in addition to common guiding principles.\" As for the matters expressed as \"-\" in the table, each AI business actor is expected to implement the actions described in the \"Part 2.

(\"2) Safety\", \"6) Transparency\")\n- \uf0d8 Specifically, employing diverse internal and independent external testing measures, through a combination of methods such as red-teaming 25 , and implementing appropriate mitigation to address identified risks and vulnerabilities\n- \uf0d8 In support of such testing, developers should seek to enable traceability, in relation to datasets, processes, and decisions made during system development.\n- II) Identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, and, where appropriate, incidents and patterns of misuse, after deployment including placement on the market. (\"5) Ensuring security \" and \"7) Accountability\")\n- \uf0d8 Use, as and when appropriate commensurate to the level of risk, AI systems as intended and monitor for vulnerabilities, and take appropriate action to address these.\n- \uf0b2 encouraged to maintain appropriate documentation of reported incidents and to mitigate the identified risks and vulnerabilities, in collaboration with other stakeholders.\n- III) Publicly report advanced AI systems' capabilities, limitations and domains of appropriate and inappropriate use, to support ensuring sufficient transparency, thereby contributing to increase accountability. (\"6) Transparency\" and \"7) Accountability\")\n- \uf0d8 Make a reasonable explanation of what decision was made, starting with the source of the data, and document and publish it to ensure traceability.\n- \uf0d8 Document and publish in a clear and understandable manner so that relevant stakeholders can interpret the output of the AI system and use it appropriately by AI business users and non-business users\n- IV) Work towards responsible information sharing and reporting of incidents among organizations developing advanced AI systems including with industry, governments, civil society, and academia. ('5) Ensuring security', \"6) Transparency\", \"7) Accountability\", \"10) Innovation\")\n- \uf0d8 These include reports on monitoring results and documents related to security and safety risks.\n\n24 For details, refer to \"II. Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles for All AI Actors and for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems\" of \"Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework\" in \"Hiroshima AI Process G7 Digital &amp; Tech Ministers' Statement\" adopted in the G7 Digital &amp; Tech Ministers' Meeting (December 2023).\n\nhttps://www.soumu.go.jp/menu_news/s-news/01tsushin06_02000283.html\n\n25 A team that verifies the effectiveness of security response system and countermeasures from the perspective of how attackers attack target organizations.\n\n- V) Develop, implement and disclose AI governance and risk management policies grounded in a risk-based approach - including privacy policies, and mitigation measures, in particular for organizations developing advanced AI systems. (see \"(4) Privacy protection\", \"7) Accountability\")\n- \uf0d8 If appropriate case, publish privacy policy\n- \uf0d8 It is expected to establish and disclose AI governance policies and practices.\n- VI) Invest in and implement robust security management, including physical security, cyber security and security measures against internal threats, throughout the AI lifecycle. (\"5) Ensuring security\")\n- \uf0d8 Consider operational measures for information security and appropriate cyber/physical access control, etc.\n- VII) Develop and deploy reliable content authentication and provenance mechanisms, where technically feasible, such as watermarking or other techniques to enable users to identify AI-generated content. (\"6\" Transparency\")\n- \uf0d8 Specifically, it includes content authentication and usual mechanisms created by the organization's advanced AI systems where appropriate and technically feasible.\n- \uf0d8 Make effort to develop tools and APIs that allow AI business users and non-business users to determine whether or not specific content through watermarks has been created using advanced AI systems.\n- \uf0b2 It is encouraged to introduce other mechanisms, such as labelling and disclaimer labelling, to help AI business users and non-business users know that they are interacting with the AI system.\n- \uf0d8 Prioritize research to reduce social, safety and security risks and prioritize investment in effective mitigation measures (\"10) Innovation') Includes research on improving AI safety, security, reliability, and handling risks\n- VIII) Prioritize research to mitigate societal, safety and security risks and prioritize investment in effective mitigation measures. (\"10 Innovation\")\n- \uf0d8 Implement efforts to develop reliable, human-centric AI, and at the same time provide support for the improvement of literacy among non-business users.\n- IX) Prioritize the development of advanced AI systems to address the world's greatest challenges, notably but not limited to the climate crisis, global health and education. (\"10) Innovation\").\n- \uf0d8 Contribute to the development of international technical standards and best practices, including watermarks, use them if appropriate, and go along with the Standard Development Organization (SDO)\n- X) Advance the development of and, where appropriate, adoption of international technical standards. (\"2) Safety\" and \"3) Fairness\")\n- \uf0d8 Appropriate measures to manage the quality of data, such as training data and data collection, are encouraged to mitigate harmful bias\n- \uf0d8 Appropriate transparency of the training dataset should also be supported and adherence to applicable legal frameworks\n- XI) Implement appropriate data input measures and protections for personal data and intellectual property. (\"5) Ensuring security\" and \"8) Education and literacy\")\n- \uf0d8 Provide opportunities to improve the literacy and awareness of each AI business actor and stakeholder, including issues such as how advanced AI systems increase specific risks (e.g., those related to the proliferation of fake information) and how new risks are created\n- It is encouraged to collaborate among AI business actors to share information to identify and handle new risks and vulnerabilities associated with advanced AI systems.\n\n- XII) Promote and contribute to trustworthy and responsible use of advanced AI systems. (\"5) Ensuring security\" and \"8) Education and literacy\")\n- \uf0d8 Provide  opportunities  to  improve  their  own  and,  where  appropriate,  others'  digital literacy, training and awareness, including on issues such as how advanced AI systems may exacerbate certain risks (e.g. with regard to the spread of disinformation) and/or create new ones\n\n## E. Building AI governance\n\nIn order to implement the common guiding principles across value chains with the cooperation of AI business actors and use AI safely and securely, it is important to build AI governance that manages risks posed by AI at levels acceptable to stakeholders and maximizes their benefits. In order to create Society 5.0, it is also essential to socially implement a system that merges the cyberspace and physical space in an advanced way (CPS) and build appropriate AI governance for the system. A society with CPS set as its foundation is complex and rapidly changes, and it is difficult to control the risks in such a society. Those social changes cause the goals targeted by the AI governance to continuously change. Therefore, it is important to practice agile governance instead of regular AI governance where the predefined rules or procedures remain unchanged. In agile  governance,  multiple  stakeholders  continuously  and  rapidly  run  a  cycle  consisting  of environment and risk analysis, goal setting, system design, operation, and then evaluation in various governance systems in companies, regulations, infrastructure, markets, social codes and the like 26 .\n\nFor specific studies, it is important to take into consideration the severity and probabilities of risks posed by the AI developed, provided, or used by each AI business actor and limitations on the resources of each AI business actor.\n\n- (1) Each AI business actor first conducts an environment and risk analysis for the AI system or service based on the benefits and risks the AI system or service may bring about during  the  overall  lifecycle,  social  acceptance  relating  to  the  development  and operation, changes in the external environment, and the maturity of AI.\n- (2) Then, according to the analysis results, each AI business actor determines whether to develop, provide, or use the AI system or service. If it decides to do so, consider setting AI  governance  goals 27    by  establishing  policies  relating  to  AI  governance.  These  AI governance goals should be consistent with each AI business actor's reason for existence and management goals such as philosophy and vision.\n- (3) After that, each AI business actor designs the AI management system to achieve the AI governance  goals  and  operate  the  system.  In  this  stage,  each  AI  business  actor establishes transparency and ensure accountability (such as fairness) towards external stakeholders about its AI governance goals and the operation status of those goals.\n- (4) Then,  each  AI  business  actor  continuously  monitors  and  evaluates  whether  the  AI management system, including risk assessment, is effectively functioning, and make continuous improvements.\n- (5) After  the  operation  of  the AI  system or  service  commences,  each AI  business  actor repeatedly  analyzes  the  environments  and  risks  based  on  changes  in  the  external\n\n26  For reference, the appendix provides a detailed explanation for practicing AI governance based on \"Governance Guidelines for Implementation of AI Principles ver. 1.1\" by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, as well as action goals, which are specific activities that each AI business actor works on, and virtual \"practice cases\" that assume each AI business actor.\n\n27  As AI governance goals, some AI business actors might establish an action policy (the name may vary with the AI business actor, for example, \"AI policy\") that consists of action items for the common guiding principles described in the Guidelines, whereas some AI business actors might establish an action policy that includes other elements in addition to action items for the common guiding principles (data use policy, for example). Guiding principles can also be provided to increase benefits. For example, inclusion may be improved through effective use of AI. The naming is left to each AI business actor's discretion as well.\n\nenvironment, including those in the social system, such as regulations, and review the goals as necessary.\n\nFigure 6. Basic model of agile governance\n\nFurthermore, when studying AI governance, it is important to keep in mind the value chain and pay close attention to the following points.\n\n- \uf0d8 Secure the cooperation among AI business actors from the viewpoints of value chain and risk chain.\n- \uf0b2 Example of issues among multiple AI business actors: Understanding of AI risks, improvement of quality, creation of new values through interconnections among AI systems and services (System of Systems), development of literacy of AI business users or non-business users, and so on.\n- \uf0b2 Example of points necessary to be organized among AI business actors: Contracts concerning rights to training and using data and generated AI models.\n- \uf0d8 Clarify the risk chain including data distribution, conduct risk management activities suitable  to  each  of  the  development,  provision,  and  use  stages,  and  build  the  AI governance regimes.\n- \uf0b2 If the value and/or risk chains from AI development to service implementation are expected  to  span  across  multiple  countries,  understand  how  the  international society is studying AI governance suitable for ensuring free distribution of data (Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT)), and ensure interoperability (consisting of two aspects: \"standard\" and \"interoperability between frameworks\") that is based on that study.\n\nTo make those activities effective, the management has a great responsibility, so it is important that the management exhibits leadership. It is important to think of the building of AI governance as prior investment with the aim of achieving sustainable growth and medium- and long-term expansion of each AI business actor, not to regard the building of AI governance as costs from the viewpoint of short-term pursuit of profit. Under such leadership, run the agile governance cycle shown above and fit AI governance into the strategy of each organization and the company system expecting the cycle to take hold in each organization as its culture.\n\n## Part 3 Matters Related to AI Developers\n\nAI developers can directly design and modify AI models, so they significantly affect the output from AI as for overall AI systems and services. The society also expects them to drive innovation, so they have significant impact on the society. Therefore, it is important for AI developers to study in advance as much as possible the impacts that the AI they develop may pose when it is provided or used and take necessary measures against the impacts.\n\nWhen developing AI, excessively focusing on accuracy may cause privacy or fairness to be compromised, or excessively focusing on privacy may cause transparency to be compromised. Thus, there may be conflict between different risks or from an ethical viewpoint. In such cases, it is important that the AI developers appropriately makes decisions or corrections based on its business risks and social impacts. When an unexpected incident occurs in an AI system, any party in the AI value chain may be required to explain that incident. Bearing this in mind, it is important for AI developers to leave records that help them reasonably explain how they were involved in the AI system.\n\nThe matters important for AI developers are shown below.\n\n## \uf06c During data preprocessing and training\n\n## \uf0d8 D-2) i.

AI providers let AI gain popularity and expand within the society and significantly contribute to the growth of society and the economy. They have a considerable impact on society, so it is important that they provide AI systems and services on the precondition that AI is used properly. Therefore, in addition to examining whether the AI to be incorporated into an AI system or service is suited to the system or service, it is important  to  conduct  the  appropriate  change  management,  configuration  management,  and service maintenance works taking into account that the expectations for AI might change in accordance with changes in the business strategy or social environment.\n\nIt is important to implement AI systems and services within the expected scope of use set by AI  developers, maintain proper operation and use of the systems or services, and request AI developers to properly develop AI systems. It is important to provide AI business users with the AI service while providing and supporting the operation of the AI system or while operating the AI system. Upon provision, AI providers are expected to pay attention to prevent violations of stakeholders'  rights  and  the  occurrence  of  social  drawbacks,  etc.,  and  share  information  of incidents and the like within reasonable extent to provide safer, more secure and reliable AI systems and services.\n\nThe matters important for AI providers are shown below.\n\n## \uf06c When implementing an AI system\n\n- \uf0d8 P-2) i.

Introduction\n\n## 1.1 Purpose of This Document\n\nThe progress of AI-related technologies and their spread throughout society has been unprecedentedly rapid. In the past, AI has been used in expert systems and reinforcement learning for inference and search, and it has showed signs of spreading several times. Improvements in computing performance and semiconductor processing technology have led to the development of more efficient algorithms and the expansion of applications. In this context, the emergence of generative AI has accelerated innovation. In particular, interactive generative AI has broadened the range of applications. Furthermore, foundation models that have been trained on large datasets have been used in a wide range of applications these days, and AI-based services spread from those for general consumers to those for specific businesses and industries. Moreover, due to the high versatility of the foundation models, the use cases are also becoming more diverse, including program development using simple natural language instructions and AI agents with autonomy. The further development, provision, and use of such AI systems are expected to contribute to the promotion of innovation and the resolution of social issues. On the other hand, there are growing concerns about misuse, abuse, and inaccurate output of AI systems. Japan has led the Hiroshima AI Process towards the realization of safe, secure and trustworthy AI systems, and has contributed to the formulation of global rules related to AI safety, such as compiling \"Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems' and 'Hiroshima Process International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems.' However, for implementing AI safety, new problems and complexities inherent to AI, such as a black-box nature of the behavior of AI systems, will be issues. Another point is the wide variety of input/output variations of the generative AI. AI systems designed for specific applications may be used for a wide range of unintended purposes. Furthermore, if AI systems are not implemented and used appropriately, the psychological aspects of human beings may be adversely affected. Therefore, ensuring AI Safety is a prerequisite for the rapid progress of AI to contribute to the sustainable development of society.\n\nIn light of the above, the \"Guide to Evaluation Perspectives on AI Safety\" (hereinafter referred to as \"this document\") presents basic concepts that those\n\ninvolved in the development and provision of AI systems can refer to when conducting AI Safety evaluations. In preparing this document, \"AI Guidelines for Business (Version 1.0)\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"AI Guidelines for Business\"), which provides guidelines for appropriate use of AI by AI business operators in Japan, were used as a reference. In addition, international trends and perspectives for AI Safety which are investigated from several publications are also reflected to this document. By referring to these points, readers can gain a clear understanding of the key aspects of AI Safety evaluation. By the way, AI Guidelines for Business will be revised as a living document, incorporating insights from international discussions as necessary. Therefore, this document will also be revised as necessary in response to domestic and international discussions and technological trends on AI Safety.\n\n## 1.2 Terms Used in This Document\n\nTerms used in this document are defined as follows;\n\n## AI System\n\nA system (such as a machine, robot, and cloud system) that works at various levels of autonomy during the use process and incorporates a software element that has a learning function.\n\n(Source: Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, \" AI Guidelines for Business (Version 1.0),\" p. 9)\n\n## AI model\n\nA model incorporated into an AI system and acquired through machine learning using training data.

Within these operators, the main readers are development and provision managers (who actually manage operations related to the development and provision of AI systems) and business executive officers (who are responsible for promoting measures to maintain and/or improve AI Safety in line with their business strategies).\n\nFirst, it is important for development and provision managers to confirm that AI Safety is maintained and/or improved in the AI systems they develop or provide, from the development phase, through the initial phase of operation after the AI system is provided, to the end of the operation phase. By referring to this document, development and provision managers can understand the outline of the method for conducting AI Safety evaluation, the evaluation perspectives, and the expected evaluators and evaluation timing, etc. This will help them develop and provide AI systems with AI safety in mind. As detailed in section '4.1 Evaluator\", the development and provision manager is the main evaluator of the AI Safety.\n\nThe business executive officers are those who are ultimately responsible for AI Safety in the AI systems and related services provided by the relevant business to each stakeholder in society. It is important for them to plan for the acquisition of\n\nresources within the company and to ensure the effective implementation of each measure. Business executive officers can refer to this document to acquire and train personnel with expertise in AI Safety evaluation. It will also facilitate the preparation of AI Safety evaluation when they are conducted within the organization or outsourced to a third party (an external organization conducting the evaluation).\n\nThis document can also be referenced by individuals beyond the intended readers for conducting an AI Safety evaluation. For example, \" AI Business User\" as described in AI Guidelines for Business may refer to this document and consider it to evaluate how to use AI systems in their own organizations.\n\n## 2 AI Safety\n\n## 2.1 Purpose of AI Safety Evaluation\n\nThe purpose of an AI Safety evaluation is to ensure that the AI Safety of an AI model or AI system is maintained and/or improved. AI Safety evaluation is a comprehensive management process aimed at revealing the AI Safety status of AI models and AI systems, as well as maintaining and/or improving AI safety. If the comprehensive management is insufficient or the implementation is inadequate, AI Safety may not be properly maintained or improved, and end users of AI systems may be affected by various risks such as damage caused by inappropriate behavior of the system. To prevent this, developers and providers of AI systems should implement preventive measures to maintain and/or improve AI Safety, and conduct evaluations to confirm the effectiveness of the measures.\n\nIn the following sections, Section 2.2 presents the key elements of AI Safety based on the Guidelines for AI Business. This is an element that requires collaboration among all stakeholders involved in AI and represents the overall framework of AI Safety evaluation. In Section 2.3, perspectives for AI Safety evaluation are extracted based on evaluation items derived from major domestic and international publications. By referring to the evaluation perspectives, the person conducting the evaluation can work on the evaluation from a more specific viewpoint. Finally, Section 2.4 describes the scope of the AI safety evaluation in this document.\n\nThis document is not intended to limit the spread of technological development and utilization of AI. The AI Safety evaluation aims at further utilization of AI systems in society as a whole by evaluating their safe and secure use. In other words, it contributes to both the further promotion of innovation and the realization of safety and security.\n\n## 2.2 Key Elements of AI Safety\n\nThe Guidelines for AI Business provide ten items (human-centric, safety, fairness, privacy protection, ensuring security, transparency, accountability, education/literacy, ensuring fair competition, and innovation) as common guiding principles for each entity involved in AI. Of these 10 items, seven are specifically identified as items that AI-related entities should work together to address\n\nthroughout the value chain: human-centric, safety, fairness, privacy protection, ensuring security, transparency, and accountability. Of these seven, \"accountability\" is ensured by confirming measures for the other six, distributing and clearly stating the legal and practical responsibilities of each stakeholder to a reasonable extent, and collecting and disclosing appropriate information as necessary. Furthermore, based on recent international trends, this document defines human-centric, safety, fairness, privacy protection, ensuring security, and transparency as key elements of AI Safety. Of the above key elements, \"safety\" is to ensure that the development, provision, and use of AI systems and services do not cause harm to the lives, bodies, or property of stakeholders, and the psyche and environment. It should be noted that \"safety\" is one of the elements encompassed in AI Safety, along with other key elements.\n\n## 2.3 Evaluation Perspectives on AI Safety\n\nThis document describes evaluation perspectives on AI safety based on the recent rise of generative AI and the publications that have been developed in Japan and abroad. Specifically, in addition to the descriptions in \"C. Common Guiding Principles\" of the AI Guidelines for Business, references are made to publications related to AI safety in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Singapore (see \"List of References\"). Among the items described in each publication, those items related to any of the key elements of AI safety described in section 2.2 were selected as evaluation perspectives on AI safety. Evaluation perspectives on AI safety described in this document are related to one or more of the aforementioned key elements of AI Safety. Therefore, this document also shows the relationship between each evaluation perspective and the related key elements of AI Safety. Various studies on AI Safety evaluations are ongoing domestically and internationally across diverse fields in industry, government, and academia, and the situation is constantly changing. Therefore, this document presents the evaluation perspectives that are considered to be particularly important. The perspectives described in this document are not exhaustive and are expected to be updated in the future.\n\n## 2.4 Scope of Evaluations on AI Safety\n\nThe scope of the AI Safety evaluation in this document is organized from two points: the type of AI system and the impact of AI system.\n\n## Type of AI System\n\nMany different types of AI systems exist. Among them, Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention as an innovative technology in the field of natural language processing. Therefore, in this document, among AI systems with generative AI as a component, it focuses on AI systems with LLMs as a component (hereinafter referred to as \"LLM systems\").\n\nAlthough this document focuses on LLM systems, it also describes important issues to be considered for AI Safety related to AI systems in general, not limited to LLM systems. For example, \"2.2 Key Elements of AI Safety\" describes key elements of AI safety that should be considered for AI systems in general. In addition, some of the evaluation perspectives on AI Safety described in this document can be used for AI systems other than LLM systems. Therefore, the perspectives described in this document can be referred to when evaluating AI systems other than LLM systems.\n\nAdditionally, the evaluation perspectives for AI systems including foundational models that handle multimodal information will be considered in the future, taking into account technological and usage trends. The points to note regarding this are detailed in \"6 Considerations for Evaluation.\"\n\n## Impact of AI system\n\nIn this document, the scope of the AI safety evaluation focuses mainly on the direct impact that an AI system can have on the end users. For example, if the output of an LLM system contains harmful bias, the end users may be subjected to unjustified discrimination. It is also possible that end users may suffer psychological harm due to offensive representations contained in the LLM system's output.\n\nThe potential impact of AI systems on various stakeholders in society is called a Socio-technical Problem. Given the prevalence of AI systems in various aspects of society, it is important to consider the impact of socio-technical problems on the implementation of AI Safety evaluation. However, the evaluation policy and specific method of evaluation regarding such Socio-technical Problems are still\n\nunder discussion domestically and internationally, and will require continued consideration.\n\n## 3 Details of Evaluation Perspectives\n\nIn Section 3.1 through 3.10, the evaluation perspectives on AI Safety are explained. In each section, the following will be described:\n\n## \u25fc Outline of Evaluation Perspectives\n\nThe contents of the evaluation perspective and the state of being aimed at through evaluation will be explained.\n\n## \u25fc Relationship to Key Elements of AI Safety\n\nThe relationship between each evaluation perspective and the key elements of AI Safety will be indicated. If a single evaluation perspective is related to multiple key elements, its connection to each relevant element will be indicated.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Possible Risks\n\nExamples of actual risks that could arise in relation to the evaluation perspective, as well as examples of risks that could arise in the future will be provided.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Evaluation Items\n\nExamples of evaluation items that may be considered when evaluating each perspective will be provided.\n\nTable 1: Relationship between key elements of AI safety and evaluation perspectives on AI Safety\n\n|                    | Evaluation Perspectives on Al Safety   | Evaluation Perspectives on Al Safety                           | Evaluation Perspectives on Al Safety   | Evaluation Perspectives on Al Safety           | Evaluation Perspectives on Al Safety   | Evaluation Perspectives on Al Safety   | Evaluation Perspectives on Al Safety                 | Evaluation Perspectives on Al Safety   |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                    | Control of Toxic Output                | Prevention of Misinformati on, Disinformatio nand Manipulation | Fairness and Inclusion                 | Addressing to High-risk Use and Unintended Use | Privacy Protection                     | Ensuring Security                      | Explainability Robustness Data Quality Verifiability |                                        |\n| Human- centric     |                                        |                                                                |                                        |                                                |                                        |                                        |                                                      |                                        |\n| Safety             |                                        |                                                                |                                        |                                                |                                        |                                        |                                                      |                                        |\n| Z Fairness         |                                        |                                                                |                                        |                                                |                                        |                                        |                                                      |                                        |\n| Privacy protection |                                        |                                                                |                                        |                                                |                                        |                                        |                                                      |                                        |\n| @ Ensuring         |                                        |                                                                |                                        |                                                |                                        |                                        |                                                      |                                        |\n| Transparency       |                                        |                                                                |                                        |                                                |                                        |                                        |                                                      |                                        |\n\n## 3.1 Control of Toxic Output\n\n## \u25fc Outline of Evaluation Perspectives\n\nTo ensure that end users can use the LLM system with a sense of relief, it is important that sound content is output; readers should achieve a state where the LLM system can control the output of harmful information, such as information about terrorism and crime or offensive expressions.\n\n## \u25fc Relationship to Key Elements of AI Safety\n\nThis perspective is related to the human-centric of key elements of AI Safety in that LLM systems should be utilized in a manner that respects human rights. It is also related to safety in that it prevents harm to the lives and property of end users and other stakeholders due to the output of harmful information. Furthermore, it is related to fairness because end users may suffer psychological harm from discriminatory expressions as well.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Possible Risks\n\nIf control of toxic output is not adequate, end users may suffer psychological harm due to offensive expressions unexpectedly included in the output of the LLM system. Additionally, the LLM system could be misused to intentionally obtain harmful information.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Evaluation Items\n\nExamples of evaluation items related to 'Control of Toxic Output' are as follows:\n\n- \u27a2 When test data containing the following harmful information is input or assumed output, can the LLM system exclude the information from its output or reject the output?\n- \uf0b2 Information that could be used for cyber-attacks, terrorism and other crimes, and CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear).\n- \uf0b2 Information that may cause psychological harm to end users, such as discriminatory expressions.\n- \u27a2 Are there not any problems with the score as measured by the toxicity score (a numerical measure of toxicity, such as aggressiveness) of the LLM system's output?\n\n## 3.2 Prevention of Misinformation, Disinformation and Manipulation\n\n## \u25fc Outline of Evaluation Perspectives\n\nIt is important that the LLM system not output misinformation and disinformation and provide accurate information so that end users can use the LLM system as a reliable tool. Readers should ensure that a fact-finding mechanism is placed for LLM system outputs.\n\nFurthermore, the end user's own autonomous decision-making should be respected, and manipulation of end user's decisions by the output of the LLM system should be avoided. In particular, manipulating end-users' decisions by the output of LLM systems should be avoided when end-users refuse to be manipulated or when it would cause disadvantages to end-users.\n\n## \u25fc Relationship to Key Elements of AI Safety\n\nThis perspective is related to the human-centric of key elements of AI Safety in that LLM systems support autonomous human decision making by providing accurate information. It is also related to safety , as it aims to prevent harm to the property and psyche of the end user. Furthermore, it is also related to transparency in that it leads to end users understanding the source of the output of the LLM system.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Possible Risks\n\nIf the prevention of misinformation, disinformation and manipulation is not sufficient, the output of misinformation and disinformation from the LLM system may cause end users to make wrong decisions or be misled. In addition, the end user's behavior and emotions may be manipulated into undesirable states due to output that affects the end user. Furthermore, end users may misinterpret the output from the LLM system as information emanating from a human, which may cause psychological harm.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Evaluation Items\n\nExamples of evaluation items related to 'Prevention of Misinformation, Disinformation and Manipulation' are as follows:\n\n[Example Evaluation Items for Prevention of Misinformation and Disinformation]\n\n- \u27a2 When the same test data with factual questions are input to different LLM systems, do they output semantically identical content?\n- \u27a2 Are there not any problems with the scores as measured by the following evaluation items?:\n- \uf0b2 Relation of prompts and output data to the LLM system\n- \uf0b2 Relationship between prompts to the LLM system and search results *1 by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  *2\n- \uf0b2 Consistency of LLM system output data and search results *1  by RAG *2\n- \uf0b2 Semantic consistency between correct data and search results by RAG *2\n- *1: Search results from external databases to be input into LLM, URLs of the source of the output information for questions in a search type chatbot, etc.\n- *2: Examples of evaluation items specific to LLM systems using RAG\n- \u27a2 For LLM systems where output content is authenticated, is content authentication performed properly even when various prompts are input?\n- It is also necessary to keep in mind that the documents to be searched in the LLM system using RAGs and the correct data prepared by the evaluator for the evaluation should be factual data.\n\n## [Example Evaluation Items for Prevention of Manipulation]\n\n- \u27a2 Can the end user distinguish the output of the LLM system from information by a human?\n- \u27a2 Can the end user identify the content as output from the LLM system on news articles, social media or others?\n- \u27a2 Is the end user not induced to take actions or make choices that are objectively or subjectively disadvantageous, based on recommendations or instructions from the LLM system? Ensure that an opt-in or opt-out means of inducement (e.g., message generation including URL links, etc.) by the LLM system is provided.\n\n## 3.3 Fairness and Inclusion\n\n## \u25fc Outline of Evaluation Perspectives\n\nIt is important that the output of the LLM system be fair and free of bias and discrimination. It is also important to be inclusive and aware of the diversity of society. Readers should ensure that the output of the LLM system does not contain harmful biases and is free from unfair discrimination against any individual or group. Readers should also ensure that the output of the LLM system is understandable, i.e., highly readable, to all end users.\n\n## \u25fc Relationship to Key Elements of AI Safety\n\nThis perspective is related to the human-centric of key elements of AI Safety in that LLM systems ensure inclusiveness by providing information in a way that supports end users. It is also related to fairness in that it leads to respect for diverse cultures and the elimination of prejudice and discrimination. It is also related to transparency in that it leads to end user trust in the behavior of the LLM system.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Possible Risks\n\nInsufficient fairness and inclusion could lead to harmful bias in the output of the LLM system, which could foster unfair discrimination against certain individuals or groups. In addition, end users may not be able to properly interpret the output of the LLM system and may misinterpret the output.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Evaluation Items\n\nExamples of evaluation items related to 'Fairness and Inclusion' are as follows:\n\n- \u27a2 Can the LLM system reject responses when the test data containing harmful biases regarding diverse backgrounds such as race, gender, nationality, age, political beliefs, religion, etc. is input or expected as output?\n- \u27a2 When inputting test data whose output is assumed to be unaffected by human attributes, does the output result not change depending on the attributes?\n- \u27a2 Are there not any problems with the score as measured by the fluency score (a numerical representation of whether the output is grammatically\n\n- appropriate) of the LLM system's output?\n- \u27a2 Are there not any problems with the scores measured on the readability of the LLM system's output?\n- \u27a2 Even if grammatically incorrect test data is entered into the LLM system, is the output grammatically appropriate and human understandable?\n\n## 3.4 Addressing High-risk Use and Unintended Use\n\n## \u25fc Outline of Evaluation Perspectives\n\nWhen LLM systems are used for high-risk purposes, it is important that they are used in a manner that protects the safety and rights of end users and stakeholders. In addition, even in cases other than high-risk use, there is a risk of unforeseen consequences if the LLM system is used for inappropriate purposes that deviate from the previously envisioned appropriate use of the LLM system. Readers should take measures to prevent the use of the LLM system for other than its intended purpose, and create a situation in which no significant harm or disadvantage is caused even if the system is used for other than its intended purpose. As for high-risk use of AI systems, the contents of the EU AI Act may serve as an example. However, it is necessary to comprehensively determine the degree of risk based on relevant laws, regulations, standards, and inherent knowledge, depending on the country, region, target domain, etc. to which the LLM system is targeted.\n\n## \u25fc Relationship to Key Elements of AI Safety\n\nThis perspective is related to human-centric of key elements of AI Safety, in that high-risk use or use for other than intended purposes could affect the rights and interests of end users. It is also related to safety in terms of preventing various types of harm related to life, body, property, etc. that may occur to end users.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Possible Risks\n\nInadequate addressing high-risk use and unintended use may cause harm to life, body, and property, or infringement of human rights for end users and stakeholders of LLM systems. In addition, if the scope of development, provision, and use of LLM systems is broad, the safety of society as a whole may be compromised.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Evaluation Items\n\nExamples of evaluation items related to 'Addressing High-risk Use and Unintended Use' are as follows:\n\n- \u27a2 Even if test data for the unintended use case is input to the LLM system,\n\ncan the system avoid producing output that may harm the end user's life, body, property, etc., or various rights? Or, can the output be rejected?\n\n- \u27a2 Even if the use case of the LLM system is within the scope of the intended purpose, can the system avoid producing output that may harm the end user's life, body, property, etc., or various rights? Or, can the output be rejected?\n\n## 3.5 Privacy Protection\n\n## \u25fc Outline of Evaluation Perspectives\n\nIt is important for LLM systems to protect privacy from the perspective of fostering confidence in LLM systems by protecting the privacy of end users and stakeholders and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, etc. Readers should confirm that the LLM system protects privacy appropriately according to the importance of the data it handles.\n\n## \u25fc Relationship to Key Elements of AI Safety\n\nThis perspective is directly related to privacy protection of key elements of AI Safety.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Possible Risks\n\nIf privacy protection is not sufficient, individuals in the training data could be identified through the responses to end users from the LLM system, membership inference attacks (attacks that infer whether specific data is included in the training data of an AI model), etc.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Evaluation Items\n\nExamples of evaluation items related to 'Privacy Protection' are as follows:\n\n- \u27a2 When test data that includes information about individuals that should be protected is used as the assumed output, can the LLM system avoid output that information contrary to the design intent?\n- \u27a2 Can the system prevent the recovery of personal information contained in the training data of the AI model by analyzing the inputs and outputs of the LLM system?\n- \u27a2 Even if the LLM system does not directly output information about individuals, it may still be possible to identify individuals from the training data by combining multiple outputs. Can such cases be prevented?\n- \u27a2 If an LLM system utilizing RAG is deployed, and the search destination by RAG includes information related to individuals, is the output of information related to individuals controlled?\n\n*Refer to 'Guide to Red Teaming Methodology on AI Safety' for details on\n\nevaluating threats from malicious attacks.\n\n## 3.6 Ensuring Security\n\n## \u25fc Outline of Evaluation Perspectives\n\nEnsuring Security is important to minimize the impact of malicious attacks on LLM systems and misconfigurations due to human error. In addition to general cybersecurity and AI security, readers should also take into consideration LLM system-specific vulnerabilities* to prevent the leakage of confidential information due to unauthorized operations and unintended modification or shutdown of the LLM system by addressing vulnerabilities across the entire LLM system.\n\n(*Source: OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications)\n\n## \u25fc Relationship to Key Elements of AI Safety\n\nThis perspective is directly related to ensuring security of key elements of AI Safety.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Possible Risks\n\nIf ensuring security is not sufficient, unintended operation of the LLM system may cause damage to the life, body, property, etc. of end users. In addition, leakage of confidential information could cause a company to lose its competitive advantage and damage its reputation.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Evaluation Items\n\nExamples of evaluation items related to 'Ensuring Security' are as follows:\n\n- \u27a2 Even if the LLM system repeatedly inputs multiple test data that are difficult and costly to process, can the LLM system avoid performance degradation or system outages?\n- \u27a2 Is it not possible to circumvent LLM system defenses through prompt injection or other means, and is it not possible to perform unintended operations on the LLM system back-end systems?\n- \u27a2 In the LLM system using RAG, is it ensured that there are no deficiencies in the settings of access privileges for the sources used by RAG, to prevent the output of confidential information?\n- \u27a2 Are there protective measures in place at the input stage to the LLM\n\nsystem, such as prompt detection utilizing prohibition lists?\n\n- *Refer to 'Guide to Red Teaming Methodology on AI Safety' for details on evaluating threats from malicious attacks.\n\n## 3.7 Explainability\n\n## \u25fc Outline of Evaluation Perspectives\n\nAppropriate visualization of the rationale for LLM system output allows end users to confirm the credibility of the output, thereby making the output more convincing and reducing misunderstandings and distrust. It is also important from the perspective of reducing the gap between the end user's judgment and the domain experts' judgment, and building trust among end users with insufficient domain expertise. Readers should ensure that the rationale for the output can be confirmed to a technically reasonable extent for the purpose of presenting evidence of the LLM system's operation, etc.\n\n## \u25fc Relationship to Key Elements of AI Safety\n\nThis perspective leads to the end user understanding how the LLM system made decisions regarding outputs. Therefore, it is related to transparency of  key elements of AI Safety.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Possible Risks\n\nInsufficient explainability may prevent the end user from determining the accuracy of the results output by the LLM system. As a result, incorrect decisions may be made.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Evaluation Items\n\nExamples of evaluation items related to 'Explainability' are as follows:\n\n- \u27a2 When various test data are input in an LLM system equipped with a function to visualize the output rationale (internal operation, its status, source, etc.), is the output rationale displayed?\n- \u27a2 In an LLM system that performs stepwise inference, is it possible to present to the end user the inference process leading up to the output?\n\n## 3.8 Robustness\n\n## \u25fc Outline of Evaluation Perspectives\n\nWhen robustness in the LLM system is ensured, end users will perceive the LLM system as a reliable source of information. Furthermore, they will be able to use the LLM system with a sense of relief. Readers should ensure that the LLM system provides stable output against unexpected inputs such as adversarial prompting, garbled data, and erroneous input.\n\n## \u25fc Relationship to Key Elements of AI Safety\n\nThis perspective leads to the LLM system being able to provide stable output to the end user and the end user being able to better understand the output process. Therefore, it is related to transparency of key elements of AI Safety. It is also related to safety because maintaining a certain level of performance in various situations helps prevent end users from making wrong decisions.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Possible Risks\n\nIf robustness is not sufficient, the output of the LLM system may not be stable. As a result, end user confidence in the LLM system may not be fostered.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Evaluation Items\n\nEvaluation items for 'Robustness' are as follows:\n\n- \u27a2 Is there consistency in the output when same test data is entered into the LLM system multiple times?\n- \u27a2 Is there consistency in the output when multiple semantically similar test data are entered into the LLM system?\n- \u27a2 Does the system work stably even when perturbed test data (e.g., erroneous input, adversarial prompting, garbled data, data containing notational distortions, etc.) is input?\n\n## 3.9 Data Quality\n\n## \u25fc Outline of Evaluation Perspectives\n\nData quality in LLM systems is important because it affects the credibility, consistency, and accuracy of output, etc. Readers should ensure that the data accessed by LLM systems are in an appropriate state, including during model training, and that the history of the data is properly managed.\n\n## \u25fc Relationship to Key Elements of AI Safety\n\nThis perspective is related to safety and fairness of key elements of AI Safety because high-quality data leads to the provision of LLM systems that can adequately assist end users. Data quality is also associated with increased transparency and user confidence in the system.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Possible Risks\n\nInsufficient data quality may degrade the performance of the LLM system, for example, by preventing proper training of the models used in the LLM system. In addition, the reliability of the LLM system's output may be reduced due to the use of data with quality problems.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Evaluation Items\n\nExamples of evaluation items related to 'Data Quality' are as follows:\n\n- \u27a2 Are there not any quality issues with the data (training data, test data, data for RAG, etc.) that would adversely affect the LLM system? (Example items below)\n- \uf0b2 Is the accuracy of the data maintained?\n- \uf0b2 Is the data not corrupted?\n- \uf0b2 Is the data grammatically appropriate and understandable by humans?\n- \uf0b2 Is the distribution of data free from biases related to factors such as race, gender, nationality, age, political beliefs, religion, and other attributes?\n- \uf0b2 Does the data not contain any inappropriate content, such as offensive language directed at the user?\n- \uf0b2 Does the data not contain any information that could be used for cyber-attacks or terrorism?\n\n- \uf0b2 Does the data not contain 'personal data, confidential information or other information' that may result in issues relating rights including copyrights, or legally protected interests?\n- \uf0b2 Is the data ready for training purposes through measures such as Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)?\n- \uf0b2 Is there appropriate data configuration management?\n- \uf0b2 If annotation is automated, is it done appropriately?\n- \uf0b2 Does the data not contain any malicious or malfunctioning programs?\n- \uf0b2 Is the data provenance being properly managed, for example, through the use of tools?\n\n## 3.10 Verifiability\n\n## \u25fc Outline of Evaluation Perspectives\n\nReaders should ensure that various types of verification against LLM system are available from the model training phase and the development/provision phase of the LLM system to the time of use. Specifically, readers should ensure that is possible to verify how the system is operating and how the development and provision process was conducted. This will attribute to AI Safety evaluations regarding other perspectives.\n\n## \u25fc Relationship to Key Elements of AI Safety\n\nThis perspective is related to transparency of key elements in AI safety, in that it leads to end users understanding the behavior of LLM systems.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Possible Risks\n\nInsufficient verifiability may prevent the identification of the causes of AI Safety-related problems when they occur. As a result, measures to prevent recurrence may not be implemented.\n\n## \u25fc Examples of Evaluation Items\n\nExamples of evaluation items related to 'Verifiability' are as follows:\n\n- \u27a2 Is the design capable of verifying the outline of the system, model, and data, its lineage, and its operation from logs and technical specifications by the  following  methods,  and  is  the  design  capable  of  evaluating  the perspectives in section 3.1 to 3.9?\n- \uf0b2 Have system cards, model cards, and data cards been created?\n- \uf0b2 Are data logs properly recorded when various test data are entered into the LLM system?\n\n## 4 Evaluator and the Evaluation Timing\n\n## 4.1 Evaluator\n\nThe  primary  conductors  of  AI  Safety  evaluation  are  development  and  provision managers in AI development and AI provision.\n\nWhich role will conduct the evaluation depends on the lifecycle of the AI system. For example, an AI Developer may conduct the evaluation at the stage of training data preparation and AI model development related to the AI system, while an AI Provider may conduct the evaluation at the stage of integrating the AI system into applications,  etc.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  consider  the  assignment  of  roles according to each stage of the lifecycle.\n\nAI Safety evaluations are generally expected to be conducted within the organization  itself.  Primarily,  those  directly  involved  in  the  development  and provision of the AI system will conduct the evaluation. However, to ensure objective evaluation and to provide independence regarding the content of recommendations related to decision-making on system development and provision, it is also effective to have evaluations conducted by experts in the own/other organization who are not directly involved in the development or provision of the system.\n\nFor the same reason, third-party evaluations can also play a complementary role in ensuring objectivity and reliability. Although such efforts are still in the process of spreading, there are already operators in Japan that conduct third-party AI system evaluations. In other fields, such as the accounting field, evaluation mechanisms including third-party audits have been established. It is expected that third-party AI Safety evaluations mechanisms will develop in the AI field as well, based on the above.\n\n## 4.2 Evaluation Timing\n\nThere are three types of phases in the flow to utilize LLM system: development, provision, and use. The timing of the AI Safety evaluations should be reasonable and  appropriate  in  each  phase.  In  addition,  the  AI  Safety  evaluations  will  be conducted not only once, but repeatedly.\n\nIn terms of the phases of LLM systems, the development phase covers data\n\npreprocessing and training (including data collection) to development (including LLM training/creation and LLM verification). The provision phase covers from implementation in an AI system (including LLM system validation, LLM integration, and linkage) to provision. The use phase covers the period during which the LLM system is used.\n\nDepending on these phases, the range of the evaluation will differ. First, during data collection and preprocessing in the development phase, the range of evaluation is the data used to train the LLM system. Next, the LLM is the range of evaluation during the LLM training/creation and LLM verification in the development phase. Then, after the LLM system verification in the provision phase and during the use phase, the entire LLM system is in the range of evaluation. Refer to Figure 1 for the range of evaluation in each phase. This figure is partially adjusted for the LLM system by referring to Figure 3 \"Correlation between AI business actor and general AI use flow\" in the AI Guidelines for Business.\n\nFigure 1: Evaluation timing in the flow to utilize LLM system\n\nNext, the three evaluation ranges shown in the above Figure 1 are explained using component diagrams. The component diagram is created with reference to the \"LLM Application Data Flow\" in OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications.\n\n- \u25fc Range of evaluation (1): Data\n\nIn the evaluation range (1) of the development phase, evaluators evaluate whether there are any AI Safety issues in the data content. This data has been derived and formed from external data sources, etc. for fine-tuning data, training data and others.\n\nFigure 2: Range of evaluation (1) (data)\n\n- \u25fc Range of evaluation (2): LLM In the evaluation range (2) of the development phase, whether there are any problems related to AI safety in the output of LLM is evaluated. The evaluation encompasses the LLM with the actual data introduced.\n\nFigure 3: Range of evaluation (2) (LLM)\n\n- \u25fc Range of evaluation (3): Entire LLM System In the evaluation range (3) of the provision phase/use phase, the LLM system's output are evaluated for any AI Safety-related issues. Since the LLM system is continuously trained during the process of use, it is important to conduct the evaluation continuously as well. External components, such as downstream services, knowledge databases in external RAGs, and external data sources, should also be noted as factors that can affect the final output to the end user.\n\nFigure 4: Range of evaluation (3) (Entire LLM system)\n\n## 5 Evaluation Methods\n\nThere are two methods in AI Safety evaluations: technical and managerial.\n\n## 5.1 Technical Evaluation\n\nThe  technical  evaluation  will  mainly  focus  on  the  technical  aspects  of  the  data, input/output, system configuration, and various settings used in the AI system.\n\n## 5.1.1 Tool-based Evaluation\n\nOne type of technical evaluation is tool-based evaluation. Recently, part of AI Safety evaluations can be conducted automatically and efficiently using tools. On the other hand, it is difficult  to automatically  conduct all  of  the perspectives for AI Safety evaluations by tools. It is important to conduct AI Safety evaluations effectively by combining it with other methods. An example of combining with other methods is the use of manual tools in the red teaming evaluation described below. For example, tools exist to assist in the work required to conduct red teaming.\n\n## 5.1.2 Evaluation by Red Teaming\n\nIn  particular,  in  order  to  conduct  detailed  confirmation  of  attack  resilience  from malicious  users,  it  is  important  to  conduct  evaluations  by  examining  detailed scenarios of possible risk occurrence, in addition to using tools. In doing so, the evaluation  could  be  conducted  not  theoretically,  but  on  the  actual  system environment.  This  type  of  evaluation  is  known  as  red  teaming.  Although  this document does not describe the details, please  refer  to \"Guide  to Red Teaming Methodology  on  AI  Safety\"  that  describes  the  significance  of  red  teaming,  the assumed  flow  when  red  teaming  is  conducted,  the  role  of  the  conductor,  and considerations when red teaming is conducted.\n\n## 5.1.3 Other Technical Evaluation\n\nIn addition to the above, there are other methods of technical evaluation related to AI  systems.  For  example,  it  may  be  possible  to  refer  to  various  benchmarks, checklists,  balance  scorecards  etc.  related  to  each  perspectives  of  AI  safety evaluations and determine whether the outputs and training data from the LLM system  are  compatible  with  them.  It  is  also  possible  to  determine  from  actual configuration  screens  and  logs  whether  each  component  of  the  LLM  system  is operating properly from the each perspective of AI Safety evaluations.\n\n## 5.2 Managerial Evaluation\n\nIn the managerial evaluation, the evaluation will be conducted mainly on the company's overall policies on AI safety and the rules and regulations established within the company. Whether AI safety is maintained and/or improved is evaluated through training and exercises within the organization. In addition, through document review, it is evaluated whether documents related to AI safety are properly prepared. For details on the measures to be covered in such a managerial evaluation, please refer to the AI Guidelines for Business and ISO/IEC 42001:2023 (Information technology - Artificial intelligence - Management system).\n\n## 6 Considerations for Evaluation\n\nAs described in \"2.4 Scope of Evaluations on AI Safety,\" this document describes the evaluation perspectives for LLM systems. Recently, however, foundation models that handle not only text but also multiple types of data, such as images and voice, are rapidly becoming popular. As functions and inputs become more sophisticated and complex, in AI systems that include such foundation models that handle multimodal information, the types and scale of risks are expected to increase accordingly. For example, as a type of prompt injection, there could be an attack that sensitive information may be extracted from the system when an image designed to confuse the system is input, in scenarios where the system is meant to convert the content of the input image into text.

utilization  rapidly advanced in both public and private sectors in ways that foster innovation in industry and address social issues.\n\nUnder  these  circumstances,  the  G7  Summit  was  held  in  Japan  in  2023  aiming  to promote safe, secure, and trustworthy AI. The G7 Summit, chaired by Japan, concluded 'The Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles for Organizations Developing Advanced AI  System', 1 'The  Hiroshima  Process  International  Code  of  Conduct  for Organizations  Developing  Advanced  AI  Systems' 2 and  'The  Hiroshima  Process International Guiding Principles for All AI Actors'. 3 AI governance is actively discussed in multinational frameworks such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the OECD. Furthermore, government bodies in various countries are also actively promoting the  use  of AI,  while  managing  potential  risks  and  setting  rules  to  ensure  proper AI governance across government operations.\n\nTo  respond  promptly  and  flexibly  to  social  changes  by  embracing  the  use  of  new technologies, the Japanese Government has been taking measures to promote the safe and secure use of AI. This includes the publication of the AI Guidelines for Business Ver 1.1 (by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications; Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry on November 22, 2024. Hereinafter referred to as the AI Guidelines for Business), 4 which aims to support voluntary efforts by businesses and other entities.\n\nThe Priority Plan for the Advancement of a Digital Society (approved by the Cabinet on June 21, 2024) stated that AI would create a virtuous circle to accelerate innovation and that it is necessary to manage various risks associated with AI, including generative AI, and to ensure a safe and secure environment. The plan also stated that rules serving as guardrails to ensure the safety and security of AI use are also necessary, for the sake of promoting innovation as well. 5\n\nMoreover,  ministries  and  agencies  are  considering  utilizations  of  generative AI  in\n\n1   Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles for Organizations Developing Advanced AI System https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/100573471.pdf\n\n2   Hiroshima Process International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/100573473.pdf\n\n3   Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles for All AI Actors\n\nhttps://www.soumu.go.jp/hiroshimaaiprocess/pdf/document03_en.pdf\n\n4 AI Guidelines for Business Ver 1.1\n\nhttps://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/001002576.pdf\n\n5 Priority Plan for the Advancement of a Digital Society\n\nhttps://www.digital.go.jp/en/policies/priority-policy-program\n\ndifferent tasks and works. The Digital Agency hosts AI Ideathon and Hackathons, which aim  to  solve  administrative  issues  by  using  AI,  and  implements  various  projects  to experiment  generative AI  system  utilizations. Through  these  initiatives,  use  cases  are discovered and verifications are carried out by trial environments, for achieving practical uses of AI across the government.\n\nThis guideline aims to boost uses and secure risk management of generative AI 6 in the Japanese Government, by setting scheme for AI governance, framework for sharing best practices,  and  the  considerations  regarding  risks  associated  with  the  procurement  and utilization of generative AI within the government. This guideline also shows a scheme for  totally  enhancing  functionality,  quality,  and  cost-effectiveness  of  generative  AI systems utilized by the government.

Instead, government staff acting as Planners and Providers are required to ensure compliance with this guideline and actions based on it throughout procurement procedures, contracts with these businesses, supervision of contracted businesses, and cooperation with generative AI system providers.\n\n15 Even though this guideline is not directly applied to the users, they are required to comply with the rules related to generative AI utilization formulated by the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) and the utilization rules for each generative AI system formulated by planners, taking this guideline into account. (For more details, refer to \"6.6 Matters to be Addressed by Users of Generative AI Systems in Government\")\n\n16   Because this guideline is intended for national government uses and the AI Guidelines for Business mainly targets the private sector, meanings of these corresponding words are not always exactly the same.\n\n## 2.2.4 Effective Date of this Guideline\n\nThe complete application of this guideline to government information systems shall be to generative AI systems procured and utilized from the fiscal year 2026 onward (including procurement procedures such as planning and public notices conducted before the end of March 2026 for the fiscal year 2026 projects). Alignment with this guideline shall also be requested for generative AI systems procured and utilized in fiscal year 2025.\n\nConsidering the advancement of generative AI utilization across various ministries and agencies, initiatives related to \"4. Boosting the Use of AI and Establishing Structures for Strengthening and Promoting AI Governance\" shall also be initiated from the fiscal year 2025.\n\nThis guideline evolves and integrates the framework of the Japanese Government's proper grasp of generative AI as established by the 'Agreement on the Use of Generative AI such as ChatGPT (Version 2.1),' from the perspective of promoting both risk management and utilization. This guideline will replace the previous agreement.\n\n## 3 Policy for the Government's Utilization of Generative AI\n\n## 3.1 Government Policy for utilizations of Generative AI\n\nUtilizations  of  generative AI  in  the  government  involve  risks  such  as  information leakages and generation of inappropriate expressions. On the other hand, utilizations of generative  AI  have  potentials  of  realizing  efficiency  and  sophistication  of  various administrative tasks and procedures, which can significantly advance the evolution and innovation of public administration, including reforms of work style and improvements in public services. Furthermore, it is crucial for the government to take the lead in utilizing AI in order to promote its safe and secure uses across society and enhance international competitiveness of Japan's AI industry.\n\nTo this end, each ministry or agency shall actively consider integrating generative AI into their operations while undertaking the following measures:\n\n- (1) Each ministry or agency shall work to strengthen AI governance by such means as establishing  a  framework  for  the  control  and  supervision  of  AI  systems,  for example, by appointing a Chief AI Officer (CAIO).\n- \u00e0 Refer  to  '4.  Boosting  the  Use  of  AI  and  Establishing  Structures  for Strengthening and Promoting AI Governance.'\n- (2) All individuals involved in the procurement and utilization of generative AI within each ministry or agency shall understand both the benefits and risks of generative AI.\n- \u00e0    Refer  to  '5.  Boosting  the  Use  of  Generative AI  with  an  Understanding  of Benefits and Risks.'\n- (3) Individuals  involved  in  the  procurement  and  utilization  of  generative AI  within each  ministry  or  agency  shall  understand  measures  for  mitigating  the  risks associated with generative AI. They should implement appropriate risk countermeasures  and  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  generative AI  utilizations  by improving the quality of generative AI systems and optimizing methods of utilizing them.\n- \u00e0 Refer  to  '6.  Government  Rules  for  the  Procurement  and  Utilization  of Generative AI.'\n\nWhen undertaking the above measures, in order to steadily promote the utilization of generative AI throughout the government, firstly, each ministry or agency shall swiftly implement  generative AI  utilizations  in  areas  considered  to  have  lower  risk,  such  as internal administrative tasks.\n\nSecondly, even for generative AI utilizations that may pose relatively high risks (refer to '3.2 Approach to High-Risk Generative AI Utilization'), initiatives that contribute to the evolution and innovation of public administration shall be supported in ways that such generative AI utilizations are realized in as safe and effective as possible manner by taking appropriate risk countermeasures.\n\nTo  this  end,  each  ministry  or  agency  shall  proactively  promote  the  utilization  of generative  AI  in  ways  that  contribute  to  the  evolution  and  innovation  of  public administration,  while  conducting  risk  assessments  tailored  to  specific  use  cases. Regarding generative AI utilization that are likely to pose high risks, they shall report the content  of  projects,  risk  mitigation  measures,  and  quality  assurance  plans  to  the 'Advanced AI  Utilization Advisory  Board.'  The  'Advanced AI  Utilization Advisory Board' will provide advice considering status of internal and external AI utilizations in governments, including cases of best practice, development of rules, and establishment of evaluation methods for generative AI systems.\n\nFurthermore, each ministry or agency shall make efforts to identify utilization methods that contribute to the evolution and innovation of public administration and improve the functionality, quality, and cost-effectiveness of the entire generative AI system they use within each ministry or agency. As necessary, they shall effectively leverage the functions of  the  aforementioned  'Advanced  AI  Utilization  Advisory  Board'  and  the  'AI Consultation Desk,' which will be mentioned later.\n\n## 3.2 Approach to High-Risk Generative AI Utilization\n\nThe Chief AI Officer (CAIO) of each ministry or agency shall conduct risk assessments tailored to specific utilization cases in collaboration with planners and appropriately determine the risk classification (including whether the cases are likely to be high-risk).\n\nWhen determining risk classification, the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) of each ministry or agency shall make the final decision in collaboration with planners based on the results of '[Appendix 1] High-Risk AI Project Finder' (hereinafter referred to as the 'HighRisk AI Project Finder'). The High-Risk AI Project Finder indicates the risk classification aligned with the risk axes presented in Table 4.\n\nIn cases where it is determined that a utilization case of generative AI system is likely to be classified as high-risk, the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) should report the case to the\n\n'Advanced AI Utilization Advisory Board.' (*Even if it is determined that a utilization case is not likely to be classified as high-risk, consultation with the Digital Agency is possible, as necessary)\n\nTable 4: Risk Axes and Approach\n\n| Risk Axes                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Viewpoints                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| A: Scope and types of users                          | The degree of risk and its extent of its impact vary depending on the scope of generative AI with which to be procured/utilized.

The Digital Agency will operate the secretariat office.\n\nThe 'Advanced AI Utilization Advisory Board' will be also participated by the Digital Agency and the AI Safety Institute (AISI) as board and secretariat members to operate effectively, leveraging their expertise and capabilities.\n\n'The Advanced AI Utilization Advisory Board' will have the following roles:\n\n- \u00b7 Recognizing the procurement and utilization status of generative AI in each ministry or agency\n- \u00b7 Providing advice on evaluation and risk mitigation related to the procurement and utilization of generative AI systems by each ministry or agency, which are highly likely to be classified as high-risk\n- \u00b7 Identifying and disseminating best practices for the procurement and utilization of generative AI in each ministry or agency\n- \u00b7 Providing advice for identifying risk cases particular to generative AI systems in each ministry or agency and preventing their recurrence\n- \u00b7 Providing  advice  on  the  effective  utilization  of  generative AI  in  each  ministry  or agency, as well as on  the improvement  of  functionality, quality, and  costeffectiveness  of  generative  AI  systems.  This  advice  also  includes  listing  and introducing experts and government staff with advanced knowledge and extensive experiences of AI utilization\n- \u00b7 Considering revisions of this guideline\n\nThe  'Advanced  AI  Utilization  Advisory  Board'  will  review  the  guideline  in collaboration with relevant ministries and agencies, considering the overall trends in generative AI policies across the government as well as the operational status of this\n\nguideline. The Digital Agency shall convene the \"Council of Chief AI Officers (CAIO) \"  as  a  liaison  meeting  for  relevant  ministries  and  agencies,  provide  briefings  on discussions from the 'Advanced AI Utilization Advisory Board,' and offer necessary information on the utilization and governance status of generative AI in each ministry or agency.\n\nMoreover,  the  Digital  Agency  will  operate  an  \"AI  Consultation  Desk,\"  accepting questions and consultations from ministries and agencies regarding the procurement and utilization of generative AI and the operation of this guideline.\n\nThe \"AI Consultation Desk\" will receive inquiries and consultations from ministries and agencies in the government and provide necessary supports and advice from technical and professional perspectives to promptly realize effective utilizations of generative AI, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Inquiries regarding the content of the guideline\n- \u00b7 Consultations  on  methods  and  technical  aspects  for  improving  the  efficiency  of administrative tasks and enhancing administrative services by utilizing generative AI\n- \u00b7 Consultations  on  cases  where  it  is  unclear  whether  generative AI  systems  will  be classified as high-risk AI\n- \u00b7 Other  consultations  on  points  to  consider  for  risk  reduction  in  the  planning  and procurement of generative AI systems\n\nFurthermore,  the  Digital  Agency  will  establish  a  scheme  where  AI  experts  and responsible  staff  of  the  Digital  Agency  as  necessary  collaborate  with  information technology specialists dispatched by the Digital Agency to ministries and agencies, in providing  support  for  the  utilization  of  generative AI  in  projects  conducted  by  each ministry or agency.\n\n## 4.1.2 Checks under the Control and Supervision by the Digital Agency\n\nIn accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 2, Item 17 of the Act on the Establishment of the Digital Agency (Act No. 36 of 2021), the Digital Agency, as part of its control and supervision (centralized project management role), which is to oversee the development and management of national information systems, shall check the planned implementation of generative AI systems and the status of risk management measures for these systems within each ministry or agency. This information will be shared properly with the 'Advanced AI Utilization Advisory Board.'\n\n## 4.2 Development of AI Governance Frameworks within Each Ministry or Agency\n\n## 4.2.1 Appointment of Chief AI Officers (CAIO) in Each Ministry or Agency\n\nEach ministry or agency shall establish schemes for the control and supervision of generative AI systems throughout their lifecycle, including checks on procurements and contracts based on this guideline.\n\nSpecifically,  each  ministry  or  agency  shall  appoint  a  Chief AI  Officer  (CAIO)  to centrally manage generative AI systems in terms of planning, handling of administrative data, procurement, utilization, and operation, as well as risk cases particular to generative AI, enabling initiatives related to the proper procurement and utilization of generative AI.\n\nThe Chief AI Officer (CAIO) shall proactively promote the utilization of generative AI in  the  operations  of  each  ministry  or  agency.  Serving  as  a  central  authority  for establishment and implementation of AI governance within each ministry or agency, the CAIO  shall  monitor  generative AI  systems,  ensure  comprehensive  risk  management, handle risk cases particular to generative AI systems, conduct trainings to enhance AI literacy among government staff, and decide whether reports to the Advisory Board are necessary.\n\nThe Chief AI Officer (CAIO) shall assume the AI-related roles, within the duties of the Chief Information Officer responsible for the comprehensive and strategic digitalization promotion of public administration in the organization. Thus, it is expected that the Chief AI  Officer  (CAIO)  will  be  a  government  staff  of  the  level  equivalent  to  the  \"  Chief Information  Officer\"  or  the  \"Deputy  Chief  Information  Officer\"  assisting  the  Chief Information Officer within each ministry or agency. 17\n\n## 4.2.2 Report to the Advanced AI Utilization Advisory Board\n\nThe Chief AI Officer (CAIO) of each ministry or agency shall compile an ongoing comprehensive overview list of the operational status of generative AI systems within each ministry or agency, as well as their utilization status within government administration.

Selections must be made in principle from the ISMAP Cloud Service List or the ISMAP-LIU Cloud Service List, and measures specified in this guideline must be implemented separately. In other words, since measures required to address risks particular to generative AI systems need to be taken in accordance with this guideline, it is important to note that even if a service is selected from the ISMAP Cloud Service List or the ISMAP-LIU Cloud Service List, compliance with this guideline is still required.\n- (3) When utilizing cloud-service based generative AI systems in operations, which are offered to a large, unspecified number of users and accessible merely by agreeing to standard terms and conditions or rules, etc., it is in principle prohibited to deal with confidential information. Even if confidential information is not handled, it is necessary to take risks into consideration and determine an available scope of operations in advance. For individual uses, adherence to the usage procedures is required,  whereby  the  approver 22 must  assess  the  application  details  from  the planner regarding the purpose of use (operation details) and the scope of users, then  subsequently  determine  the  permissibility  of  the  uses.  Additionally,  it  is essential to supervise the usage status.\n\n22   The official who reviews and approves applications for exceptional measures.\n\n- (4) For  operational  uses  of  generative AI  in  the  government  agencies,  taking  into account  the  \"Notice  Regarding  the  Operational  Use  of  Generative AI  such  as DeepSeek' (Secretariat for the Meeting for the Promotion of a Digital Society Executive Committee, February 6, 2025), 23 it  is  essential to fully recognize the potential risks (*) associated with service uses, even when procurement actions are not involved. It is also necessary to seek advice from the National Center of Incident  Readiness  and  Strategy  for  Cybersecurity,  to  make  an  appropriate judgment, considering the intent of the \"Agreement on the Procurement Policy and Procedures for Goods and Services of the Government Related to IT Procurement.' *For example, if server equipment is located overseas, local laws and regulations may apply, and data may be censored or seized by the local governments and authorities.\n- (5) Government staff involved in the procurement and utilization of generative AI must undertake initiatives based on the 'AI Guidelines for Business, Part 2, C.

For  instance,  when  classifying  the  implementations  based  on\n\n\"whether individual development is conducted\" and \"what type of contract is made,\" the following categorization can be a basis for applying this guideline to cases:\n\nType  A:  The generative  AI system is used without conducting individual development,  by  agreeing  to  standard  terms  and  conditions  or  rules,  etc.  (In principle, it is assumed that confidential information is not handled.)\n\nType B:  The generative  AI system is used without conducting individual development,  with  individual  contracts  concluded  in  addition  to  agreeing  to standard terms and conditions or rules, etc.\n\nType  C:  Individual  development  of  the  generative AI  system  is  conducted,  and individual contract is concluded.\n\nIn  cases  that  fall  under  Type  A,  it  is  generally  assumed  that  the  uses  of  the generative AI system do not involve handling of confidential information. Therefore, it  should  be  verified  whether  it  is  unnecessary  to  establish  requirements  in  the procurement specifications or contract based on the \"Procurement Check Sheet\" and \"Contract  Check  Sheet\"  defined  in  \"6.3.2  Measures  to  be  Addressed  during  the Procurement  of  Generative AI  Systems.\"  This  includes  ensuring  that  there  are  no issues such as the presence of terms and conditions conflicting with the details in the \"Procurement Check Sheet\" and \"Contract Check Sheet.\" (If there are requirements that need to be fulfilled, consider procuring in the form of Type B or Type C.)\n\nIn cases that fall into Type B or Type C, it is necessary to consider the balance between risks and countermeasures, for each measure to be addressed in a way to that the measure is neither insufficient nor excessive, by taking the following perspectives into account:\n\n- \u30fb Project phase, such as whether it is in the Proof of Concept (PoC) stage or in the development stage in production environment\n- (e.g., implementing all measures in check sheets during the PoC stage may result in excessive countermeasures.)\n- \u30fb Risk classification, such as whether the use is potentially high-risk or not\n- (e.g.,  for  potential  high-risk  uses,  additional  measures  in  relation  to  check  sheets tailored to the use case may be necessary)\n- \u30fb Nature of use cases\n\n(e.g.,  in  cases  where  using  generative AI  system  for  searching  a  large  number  of\n\ndocuments within government offices, basic requirements such as \"output control of harmful information\" or \"prevention of output or manipulation of false/incorrect information \" in the Procurement Check Sheet may not be necessary.)\n\nAccordingly, depending on specific generative AI system projects, it is essential to consider the aforementioned implementation types, project phases, risk levels, and the nature  of  use  cases.  Considering  the  preceding  section  (paragraph  (1)  of  \"6.1.2 Measures to be Addressed Based on this Guideline\"), it is  necessary  to  assess  the balance between risks and countermeasures and to determine the required level of each measure, and to selectively incorporate or expand requirements and agreed terms as appropriate.\n\n## 6.2 Measures to be Addressed by Chief AI Officers (CAIO) of Generative AI Systems in the Government\n\n## 6.2.1 Development of Rules within Each Ministry or Agency\n\nThe Chief AI Officer (CAIO) of each ministry or agency shall develop the following rules to outline the (1) policy for generative AI uses within each ministry or agency, and (2) policy for addressing risk cases particular to generative AI systems. These rules shall be revised as needed based on revisions of this guideline as well as latest trends and the utilization status of generative AI.\n\n## (1) Rules for Users of Generative AI Systems\n\nIn order to boost proper uses of generative AI within each ministry or agency, the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) shall develop a rule for the users (government staff) of generative AI systems in each ministry or agency based on \"[Appendix 2] Model User Rule for Generative AI,\" considering following matters:\n\n- \u30fb Indispensable knowledge that government staff and other users should have before using generative AI systems, as well as important points to consider for handling confidential information\n- \u30fb Key points to be considered by government staff when utilizing generative AI,  including  (i)  uses  of  the  generative AI  systems  within  the  scope  of specified utilization purposes (as described in the utilization rules for each generative AI  system)  and  (ii)  accountability  and  risk  mitigation  of  the operations by the use of AI-generated outputs\n- \u30fb Appropriate  handling  of  documents  for  official  duties  created  by  using\n\n- (2)\n\ngenerative AI.\n\n- \u30fb Matters to be reported to the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) in the event of risk cases particular to generative AI\n\netc.\n\nRules for Addressing Risk Cases Particular to Generative AI Systems The Chief AI Officer (CAIO) shall develop rules for addressing risk cases particular to generative AI systems. (Refer  to  \"6.7  Addressing  Risk  Cases  Particular  to  Generative AI  Systems\"  for\n\n- details)\n- 6.2.2 Ensuring AI Governance within Each Ministry or Agency\n\nThe Chief AI Officer (CAIO) ensures AI governance by undertaking the actions outlined in (1) and (2) below.\n\n- (1) The Chief AI Officer (CAIO) shall establish an AI governance framework within each  ministry  or  agency  and  continuously  ensure  proper AI  governance  in  the ministry or agency. (Refer to \"4.2 Development of AI Governance Frameworks within Each Ministry or Agency \" for details.)\n- (2) The  Chief AI  Officer  (CAIO)  shall  take  necessary  measures  to  ensure  that  the procurements and utilizations of generative AI systems are conducted based on this guideline  within  each  ministry  or  agency.  In  this  regard,  the  Chief AI  Officer (CAIO)  formulates  and  revises  relevant  rules  of  the  ministry  or  agency  in accordance with this guideline, disseminates this guideline and the utilization rules for generative AI systems of the ministry or agency, and conducts training sessions (such as giving heads-up regarding input data and hallucinations).\n- 6.3 Measures to be Addressed by Planners of Generative AI Systems in the Government\n\n6.3.1 Measures to be Addressed during the Planning Stage of Generative AI Systems Planners of generative AI systems should undertake the measures listed below during the planning stage of generative AI systems. To maximize the benefits of generative AI, it is desirable for planners to proceed with deliberations by leveraging both knowledge of administrative tasks and knowledge of generative AI system aspects at the time of planning. Therefore, planners should make efforts to establish schemes where experts in the both areas can collaborate in the planning of these generative AI systems.\n\n- (1) Planners should clearly define the purpose of what they aim to achieve or solve by using the generative AI system and set appropriate goals of the project.\n- (2) Planners should conduct an environment/risk analysis for the use case, while also considering  methods  to  minimize  risks  and  developing  quality  assurance  plans throughout the operation of the generative AI system.\n- (3) For the control and supervision by the Digital Agency, planners should report on the implementation schedule of generative AI systems, results of risk analysis, risk countermeasures, handling of public administration data, and other relevant matters.\n- (4) For  generative  AI  systems  that  are  likely  to  pose  high  risks,  planners  should collaborate with the Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (CAIO) in reporting the project's purpose, risk mitigation measures, and quality assurance plans throughout their operational period to the Advanced AI Utilization Advisory Board, as stated in \"4.2.2 Reporting to the Advanced AI Utilization Advisory Board.\"\n- (5) In anticipation of expanding the uses of generative AI within the government, it is important to optimize generative AI systems across the government through data linkage between systems within government agencies, shared use of generative AI systems across ministries and agencies, and the  formation of joint projects and common systems. For instance, actively utilizing generative AI systems provided on common functions such as the Government Cloud can potentially enhance costeffectiveness, ensure security, and facilitate integration with operational systems. Therefore, planners should also consider the utilization of such services provided as common functions in the government when starting new generative AI system projects. (*)\n\n*Based on the law related to the Government Cloud (Bill to Amend Part of Act on  the  Advancement  of  Government  Administration  Processes  that  Use Information  and  Communications Technology, Act  No.  4  of  2025),  national administrative  organs  are  obligated  to  consider  as  an  option  to  utilize  the Government  Cloud  when  developing  information  systems  relevant  to  the execution of their own administrative tasks.\n\nWhen contemplating the development or renewal of systems combined with generative AI, it is necessary to consider whether it is possible to efficiently secure  a  generative  AI  environment  by  constructing  the  system  on  the Government Cloud and utilizing its packages or tools.\n\nFor further details on specific approaches to utilization methods, please refer to \"Basic Considerations for the Utilization of Government Cloud.\"\n\n- 6.3.2  Measures  to  be Addressed  during  the  Procurement  Phase  of  Generative AI Systems\n- (1) Planners should refer to \"[Appendix 3] Procurement Check Sheet (for Generative AI Systems)\" (hereinafter referred to as the \"Procurement Check Sheet\") (*) and include, in procurement specifications, the requirements (stated in the 'Procurement Check Sheet') for service providers and the generative AI systems. Additionally, based on the results of the risk analysis and other relevant factors, planners should consider adding any necessary requirement items not listed in the 'Procurement Check Sheet.'\n\n*The  \"Procurement  Check  Sheet\"  was  formulated  by  referring  to  the  AI Guidelines  for  Business  and  the  \"Guide  to  Evaluation  Perspectives  on  AI Safety (Version 1.01)\" 24 published by AISI, among others. The 'Procurement Check Sheet' organizes the requirements for procuring generative AI systems, along with examples and details of measures to meet these requirements, and examples of supporting information of them. The following perspectives are included; AI governance of generative AI suppliers, appropriate input/output and data handling, ensuring quality of LLMs and services including prevention of the output including false/incorrect information, responding appropriately to risks particular to generative AI systems, ensuring proper handling for public use cases (i.e. including indication that the output is generated by generative AI), protection of personal information and intellectual property, assurance of security and explainability, and more. By referring to the \"Procurement Check Sheet,\"  key  points  for  procuring  generative  AI  systems  can  be  checked. Therefore, it is advisable to refer to it when determining what items are to be included in the specifications, whether its supporting information should be submitted, and what information should be submitted. Since the \"Procurement Check Sheet\"  includes  only  requirements  particular  to  the  'procurement  of generative AI systems,' it is necessary to also refer to the content of the \"Digital Government  Promotion  Standard  Guidelines,\"  and  the  annex  \"Procurement\n\n24   This guideline refers to the \"Guide to Evaluation Perspectives on AI Safety (Version 1.01).\" Any amendments in response to revisions to the latest \"Guide to Evaluation Perspectives on AI Safety (Version 1.01)\" will be considered in future revisions of this guideline.\n\nSpecification  Template\"  of  the  \"Digital  Government  Promotion  Standard Guidelines Practical Guidebook\" to prepare procurement specifications.\n\n*How to Read the Procurement Check Sheet' (Refer to 'Figure 5: Image of 'Procurement Check Sheet' Requirements')\n\nFigure 5: Image of 'Procurement Check Sheet' Requirements\n\nClassification of Items for Evaluation and Selection\n\nRequirements\n\n| Oassification                          | Vlewponnts No   | Evaluation Viewpoints                                                          | Oassification of Items for Evaluation and Selecton   | Req No .   | fo generatve Al systens.

Requirements  designated  as  'Optional  Additional  Requirements  (Optional\n\nCriteria)'  are  perspectives  considered  beneficial  to  take  into  account  if necessary and are intended to serve as optional criteria in the procurement evaluation process.\n\nAs  a reference information for the Procurement Check  Sheet, the \"Reference of Requirements\" sheet provides \"Example  of Measures\", \"Detailed Example of Measures,\" and \"Examples of Supporting Information,\" which  serve  as  examples  of  measures  to  fulfill  the  requirements.  These examples will be reviewed and updated flexibly in consideration of changes in technological trends and the business environment.\n\n- (2) When  adopting  a  comprehensive  evaluation  method  or  competitive  proposal method, planners should reflect these requirements into the evaluation criteria as necessary.\n- (3) To foster the growth of domestic startups in the generative AI business, leveraging 'public procurement' is crucial. Therefore, planners should evaluate digital startups in  the  procurement  related  to  generative  AI  systems  in  accordance  with  the 'Implementation Guidelines for Evaluation Systems in Procurement for Information Systems for Expanding Opportunities for Digital Startups to Enter the Public  Procurement'  (approved  by  the  Council  for  the  Promotion  of  a  Digital Society  Executive  Board  Meeting  on  January  15,  2024).  Furthermore,  when considering SaaS-based generative AI systems or services provided by companies to support such systems' implementation, the 'Digital Marketplace' 25 operated by the Digital Agency can be utilized. By leveraging the 'Digital Marketplace,' rapid implementation  can  be  achieved,  and  diverse  businesses,  including  small  and medium-sized  enterprises  and  start-ups,  will  find  it  easier  to  access  the  public procurement  market.  Active utilizations of this 'Digital  Marketplace' are encouraged for the sake of accelerating fair competitions.\n- (4) Planners should refer to the '[Appendix 4] Contract Check Sheet (for Generative AI  Systems)'  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  'Contract  Check  Sheet')  (*)  and consider including key considerations for the procurement of generative AI systems in the contract or procurement specifications. Additionally, based on the results of the risk analysis and other relevant factors, planners should consider adding any necessary items not listed in the 'Contract Check Sheet.'\n\n25 Digital Market Place https://www.dmp-official.digital.go.jp/\n\n*The 'Contract Check Sheet' was formulated by referring to the AI Guidelines for  Business,  the  Ministry  of  Economy, Trade  and  Industry's  'Checklist  for Contracts Regarding AI Utilization and Development,' and the 'Guidelines for Contracts Regarding the Use of AI and Data,' among others. The 'Contract Check  Sheet'  organizes  items  that  need  to  be  confirmed  at  the  time  of contracting  in  the  procurement  process  of  generative AI  systems,  including ownership of rights concerning inputs of generative AI systems, the scope of provider  obligations,  ownership  of  intellectual  property  rights  related  to outputs, the scope of provider obligations in response to risk cases particular to generative  AI  systems,  the  scope  of  provider  obligations  regarding  the maintenance of expected quality standards and environmental considerations, and other matters. By referring to the 'Contract Check Sheet,' key points to be considered  in  contracts  during  the  procurement  process  of  generative  AI systems can be checked. Therefore, it is advisable to refer to it when deciding on clauses to be included in contracts or procurement specifications. Note that the 'Contract Check Sheet' only lists items particular to contracts related to the 'procurement of generative AI systems.'\n\n## *How to Read the 'Contract Check Sheet' (Refer to 'Figure 6: Image of 'Contract Check Sheet' Agreed Terms')\n\nFigure 6: Image of 'Contract Check Sheet' Agreed Terms\n\nAgreed Terms\n\nExample Clauses to be Included in the Contract\n\nSupplementary Explanations\n\n| Agrad Term   | Agrad Tans        | Exampk Cbuscs [o bc Indudcd In thc Contract   | Suppkmentary Explanatbns                           |\n|--------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n|              |                   |                                               | from using or rctaining Inpurs, 9stem ( Ihe nputs, |\n|              | Segaive Al Sysems | ngnts ofthe resUts.                           | nghts such                                         |\n|              |                   |                                               | stipulate theconditons for                         |\n|              |                   | Khch                                          | Dcfine external provisio @nditions @nditions.      |\n\nTerms to be aligned with the service provider at the time of contracting are set as \"Agreed Terms\" (as indicated in the \" Agreed Terms \" column of the 'Contract Check Sheet'). 'Agreed Terms\" should, in principle, be considered for inclusion in the contract or procurement specifications.\n\nThe  \"Example  Clauses  to  be  Included  in  the  Contract\"  and  \"Supplementary Explanations\" provide sample clauses content and supplementary explanations for incorporating agreed terms into contracts. Planners should select and incorporate these in the contract or procurement specifications as necessary, considering the features  of  the  generative AI  system  being  procured,  project  specifics,  and  risk evaluation results.\n\n## Column: SBIR Program (Small/Startup Business Innovation Research)\n\nSBIR (Small/Startup Business Innovation Research) 26 is a program aiming at supporting startups.\n\nThis program facilitates research and development by startups and other organizations,  smooth  social  implementation  of  the  outcomes  of  the  research  and development, and in turn, fosters innovation in our country.\n\nUnder  the  SBIR  program,  two  types  of  grants  are  awarded:  'Specific  New Technology Grants' and 'Designated Grants.'\n\n## 1) Specific New Technology Grants\n\nSpecific New Technology Grants refer to the grants and commissioned funds for research and development within each ministry or agency, which include research and development-type startups as eligible recipients. Target amounts are set for grants to research  and  development-type  startups  and  measures  to  increase  such  grants  are prescribed.\n\n## 2 \uff09 Designated Grants\n\nDesignated Grants are a subset of the above-mentioned Specific New Technology Grants, wherein the government sets research and development tasks based on policy needs. These were newly established in fiscal year 2025 as part of the reforms of rules.\n\nIn the field of AI, including generative AI, \"startups\" often possess cutting-edge knowledge and technology.\n\nFor this reason, when ministries and agencies operating Designated Grants compile topics addressing policy challenges and procurement needs, it is advisable to actively consider AI-related themes.\n\nAdditionally, specific support measures have been implemented to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises receiving Specific New Technology Grants under the SBIR program can generally participate in all government procurement bids, regardless of their bidding qualification grade or past delivery performances.\n\n26   SBIR Program (Small/Startup Business Innovation Research) https://www8.cao.go.jp/cstp/openinnovation/sbirseido/sbirseido.html\n\n- 6.3.3 Measures to be  Addressed during the Preparation Stage Before the Construction/Release of Generative AI Systems\n\nPlanners of generative AI systems should undertake the following processes prior to the system release.\n\n## (1) Verification of Stable Operation\n\n- \u00b7 Based  on  the  intended  purpose  and  functions,  create  test  scenarios  for input/output  verification,  test  the  input/output,  and  confirm  that  the  system operates stably and meets the expected quality standards. (*) (Example:  In  the  case  of  individual  development,  check  for  any  prohibited outputs  within  the  domain,  the  presence  of  inappropriate  generation  or  bias (social  biases  such  as  prejudices  and  discrimination  based  on  race,  ethnicity, gender,  etc.),  and  adopt  diverse/independent  internal  and  external  testing methods  such  as red teaming, to ensure fulfilling requirements in the specifications for generative AI systems.) *If it is difficult to create scenarios solely by planners, consult with users and developers.  For  systems  intended  for  public  uses,  the  individuals  conducting operation checks may include citizens. Verification and improvement of  data (such as training data and test data) may be conducted not only by planners but also  by  service  providers  (including  generative  AI  system  providers),  as\n- contractual responsibilities.\n\n## (2) Promotion of Proper Use\n\n- \u00b7 Establish utilization rules and usage methods for each generative AI system and inform them to the users of the generative AI systems (referring to internal users within ministries and agencies, as well as the citizens when the generative AI system is provided to them; the same applies hereinafter). (Examples:  Purpose  and  scope  of  generative AI  use,  available  generative AI procedures/usage methods, recommended and prohibited practices related to utilization, and other things  users  should  be  informed  of  based  on  specifics  of  the  generative AI\n- environments, types of data permissible for use, conditions / system)\n- \u00b7 Provide important information and points to consider when utilizing generative AI systems in a manner that is easily understandable and accessible for the users of the generative AI systems.\n- (Examples: Purpose and the scope of generative AI use, appropriate/inappropriate uses, technical features, foreseeable risks and\n\nmitigation  plans,  operational  status,  verification  results  of  acceptance  tests, details/status/recovery measures of risk cases particular to generative AI systems that have occurred, data collection policies, training methods, system architecture, data processing procedures, emergency contact information/inquiry desks, etc.)\n\n- \u00b7 Provide users of the generative AI system information about the purpose and usage methods (including model constraints) of the systems being used. (Examples: Availability of data upload, upper limits of numbers of prompt token, response speed, etc.)\n- \u00b7 Inform  users  of  the  generative  AI  systems  that  their  information  may  be collected by the systems. (Examples: Login histories, prompts and output results, etc. collected to fulfill appropriate oversight / accountability / investigation responsibilities of the usage\n- status)\n- 6.4  Measures  to  be  Addressed  by  Developers  of  Generative  AI  Systems  in  the Government\n\nIn the government sector, the development of generative AI systems is carried out primarily  through  outsourcing  to  service  providers.  Therefore,  the  requirements  for developers are included in requirements for procurement applicants in specifications and contracts, as detailed in \"6.3 Measures to be Addressed by Planners of Generative AI Systems in the Government.'\n\nIn cases where government staff themselves engage in the development of generative AI, they are expected to undertake the initiatives stated in \"Part 3 Matters Related to AI Developers \" of the AI Guidelines for Business.\n\n- 6.5  Measures  to  be  Addressed  by  Providers  of  Generative  AI  Systems  in  the Government\n\nProviders of generative AI systems should undertake the following processes after the releases of the systems.\n\n## (1) System Operation\n\n- \u00b7 Monitor to ensure that the output of the generative AI system meets expected quality standards and does not produce inappropriate generations nor biases. (Examples: Conduct sample checks of usage logs such as prompts and output\n\nresults  when  available,  regularly  monitor  inputs  and  outputs,  and  verify  the decision rationale to ensure they are not biased nor based on a specific cultural background.  Conduct  surveys  of  users  and  analyze  the  actual  utilization situation to check whether inappropriate generation or bias has not occurred.)\n\n- \u00b7 Regularly  verify  that  the  generative AI  system  is  being  used  for  appropriate purposes and that they are not being used in ways out of purposes. (Examples: Conduct sample checks of usage logs such as prompts and output results when available, ensuring that no input has been made that appears to be in anticipation of outputs unrelated to task operations. Conduct surveys of users and analyze actual utilization situations to evaluate the adherence to intended usage of the system.)\n- \u00b7 Check whether there is no improper handling of personal information, nor any leakage of personal/confidential information, nor violation of privacy. (Example: Conduct sample checks of usage logs such as prompts and output results  when  available,  detect  if  there  are  any  cases  where  personal  data  is suspected  to  be  used  for  an  unintended  purpose,  if  confidential  information beyond the expected input range of the generative AI systems is included in the input, and if privacy has been violated. Conduct surveys of users and analyze the actual utilization situation to check if similar incidents have occurred.)\n- \u00b7 Stay updated on the latest risks associated with generative AI systems (including diversified attack methods) and trends in their countermeasures, and implement necessary measures to address them. (Example:  Regularly  review  reports  of  information  security  incidents  (as defined in JIS Q 27000:2019), examples of risk cases particular to generative AI systems, and reports on vulnerabilities in developer models, in order to execute necessary actions.)\n- \u00b7 Conduct reviews to assess usefulness and identify issues concerning the inputoutput aspects of the generative AI system, informing users of them as necessary. (Example: Evaluate the system's inputs, outputs, and decision rationale in order to share with users effective usage methods to make the most of usefulness and provide caution to prepare for potential issues. Conduct surveys of users and analyze the actual utilization situation by asking users to share information about usefulness and issues of the system.)\n\n## (2) System Maintenance\n\n- \u00b7 Encourage service providers to make decisions regarding the improvement of\n\ngenerative AI models as necessary.\n\n(Example: Reevaluate biases among various technological components within the generative AI model and propose improvements if bad changes are identified based on the evaluation results.)\n\n- \u00b7 Consider  and  address  vulnerabilities,  in  compliance  with  the  \"  Common Standards for Cybersecurity Measures for Government Agencies and Related Agencies\" and implement necessary actions. (Example: If vulnerabilities inherent to a generative AI system's programs are detected, consider and carry out measures such as patching or model updates.)\n- (3) Addressing Risk Cases Particular to Generative AI Systems ( Refer '6.7 Addressing Risk Cases Particular to Generative AI Systems' for details\n\n)\n\n## 6.6 Measures to be Addressed by Users of Generative AI Systems in the Government\n\nUsers are required to comply with the rules in accordance with this guideline. The rules to be complied with are the utilization rules of generative AI systems established by each ministry or agency (see '6.2 Measures to be Addressed by Chief AI Officers (CAIO) of Generative AI Systems in the Government'), as well as the utilization rules for each generative AI system (see '6.3.3 Measures to be Addressed during the Preparation Stage Before the Construction/Release of Generative AI Systems).\n\n## 6.7 Addressing Risk Cases Particular to Generative AI Systems\n\nEven if all measures to address the risks, mentioned above, are implemented, it is not possible to eliminate risks entirely. Therefore, it is essential for each ministry or agency to prepare measures to be addressed in the event that risks become apparent, alongside taking measures to mitigate risks. Due to the nature of generative AI systems, there is a possibility of specific risk cases unique to these systems in relation to their output results. The following are examples of risk cases particular to generative AI systems.\n\n- \u00b7 Generative AI has produced output that could pose significant social issues, such as biases or discrimination related to race, gender, culture, etc.\n- \u00b7 Generative AI has generated aggressive or dangerous content.\n- \u00b7 Generative AI has output information that is factually incorrect (hallucination), and users have used such information, leading to their disadvantages or harm to the users or third parties.\n- \u00b7 Users have unintentionally generated content similar to existing works by using\n\ngenerative AI, potentially leading to issues such as copyright infringement. As a result, users have received requests for removal or other actions from the rights holders of the relevant works.\n\nAs measures against risk cases particular to generative AI systems, etc., government staff in each ministry or agency should implement the following.\n\n- (1) The Chief AI Officer (CAIO) should establish procedures for responding to risk cases particular to generative AI systems based on this guideline.\n- (2) If  a  risk  case  particular  to  generative AI  systems  occurs,  the  Chief AI  Officer (CAIO)  and  the  provider  of  the  generative AI  should  take  the  lead  in  taking appropriate measures, taking into consideration the degree of severity and impact.\n- (3) To enhance the ability to respond to risk cases particular to generative AI systems across the government, the Advanced AI Utilization Advisory Board (Secretariat) should  aggregate  knowledge  regarding  such  cases.  To  this  end,  the  Chief AI Officer  (CAIO)  must  report  to  the  Advanced  AI  Utilization  Advisory  Board (Secretariat) both upon the occurrence and after addressing risk cases particular to generative AI systems. The Advanced AI Utilization Advisory Board (Secretariat) will provide advice to ministries and agencies as needed regarding the risk cases.\n- (4) There is a possibility of incidents including the nature of both information security incidents and risk cases particular to generative AI systems (e.g., the training data of generative AI systems may be contaminated by cyber attackers, reducing the accuracy of the model and making it more likely to generate prejudiced outputs). Under  such  circumstances,  it  is  necessary  to  ensure  appropriate  coordination between the response frameworks of both information security incident and risk cases  particular  to  generative AI  systems,  or  to  collaborate  by  leveraging  the expertise of both frameworks. The basic protocol for this case is to follow the procedures defined by each ministry or agency for handling information security incidents.\n\nIn  the  event  of  a  risk  case  particular  to  such  generative  AI  systems,  it  is important to consider requesting necessary data from relevant business operators and  conducting  necessary  audits  to  ensure  appropriate  responses  (in  order  to ensure that these are handled appropriately, consider incorporating these measures\n\ninto contracts with the business operators related to generative AI systems).\n\n- (5) In the event of incidents such as personal information leaks related to generative AI  systems,  appropriate  measures  must  be  taken  by  following  the  procedures defined  by  each  ministry  or  agency.  In  such  situations,  there  must  be  proper coordination  between  the  personal  information  protection  response  framework and the response framework of risk cases particular to generative AI systems.\n\n## 7 Future Approaches\n\nBecause technologies related to generative AI systems are advancing day by day, procurements and utilizations of generative AI systems by the government may face unanticipated new risks. Therefore, the government will continue to review rules on procurement and utilization of generative AI in a timely manner.\n\nThe approach to introducing provenance verification 27 for generative AI involving images and videos etc. procured by the government will be continuously examined, taking into consideration the state of AI utilization within the government and trends in international discussions, etc.\n\nAdditionally,  in  fiscal  year  2025,  we  will  assess  how  to  optimize  generative AI systems across the government through data linkage between generative AI systems within government agencies, shared uses of systems between ministries and agencies, and  the  formation  of  joint  projects  and  common  systems.  These  assessments  and considerations will be reflected in future revisions of the rules.\n\nEnd of Document\n\n27   Technology that enables content to be tagged in a verifiable manner, indicating by whom, when, and how it was created, as well as any modifications made.\n\nDate of Entry\n\nAffiliation (Ministry/Department, etc.)\n\nSystem Name\n\nName of the Person Entering the Form\n\n## Risk Assessment Result\n\nPlease fill in the 'Response' column in the table below.\n\n## \u25a0High-Risk AI Project Finder Checklist\n\nPlease verify the following checklist and fill out the response section based on assumptions at the planning stage.\n\n| Viewpoints                                                                               | Checklist                                                                                                                           | Options                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Response   | Comments (Free Text)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------|\n| A.

Purpose for Formulating These Rules\n\nThe purpose for formulating these rules is to stipulate matters that staff of the Ministry of \u25cb\u25cb must adhere to and consider when using generative AI systems, in order to promote the proper utilization of generative AI by the staff, based on the \"Guideline for Japanese Governments' Procurements and Utilizations of Generative AI for the sake of Evolution and Innovation of Public Administration.\"\n\n## 2. Rules for Users of Generative AI Systems\n\nUsers of generative AI systems must comply with the following rules: (1) Rules Before Use* and (2) Rules During Use.\n\n- (*) Please also refer to the \"Notice Regarding the Operational Use of Generative AI such as DeepSeek (Administrative Notice).' 1\n\n## (1) Rules Before Use\n\n- \u00b7 Understand that while various benefits are expected by utilizing generative AI, there are also risks such as the leakage of confidential information and hallucinations. (For details  on  benefits  and  risks  of  generative  AI,  refer  to  \"5  Boosting  the  Use  of Generative AI with an Understanding of Benefits and Risks\" in the 'Guideline for Japanese Governments' Procurements and Utilizations of Generative AI for the sake of Evolution and Innovation of Public Administration.')\n- \u00b7 Understand the usage methods, security considerations, and the accuracy/risk level of  outputs  from  generative  AI  explained  by  the  planners  or  providers  of  the generative AI system (government staff who operate generative AI systems used by other government staff or citizens; the same applies hereinafter). (Example: Before using generative AI, ensure understanding of the environment in which generative AI can be used, conditions for the uses, rules, contact information for consultation, and  response  measures  for  information  security  incidents  (as  defined  in  JIS  Q\n\n1 Notice Regarding the Operational Use of Generative AI such as DeepSeek (Administrative Notice) (Japanese version)\n\nhttps://www.digital.go.jp/assets/contents/node/basic_page/field_ref_resources/d2a5bbd2-ae8f-450c-adaa33979181d26a/e7bfeba7/20250206_councils_social-promotion-executive_outline_01.pdf\n\n27000:2019) and for risk cases particular to generative AI systems.)\n\n- \u00b7 Understand in advance that input and output results from the generative AI system need  to  be  provided  to  the  system's  provider  when  necessary.  (Example:  Upon request from the Project Management Office (PJMO), if the data is accessible, submit the input data or prompts, output results, and the data provision methods/format, etc.)\n- \u00b7 When utilizing cloud-service based generative AI systems in operations, which are offered to a large, unspecified number of users and accessible merely by agreeing to standard terms and conditions or rules, etc., it is in principle prohibited to deal with confidential  information.  (As  an  exception,  handling  of  confidential  information requires  approval  from  the  Information  Security  Officer  in  accordance  with  the information  security  policy  of  the  Ministry  of \u25cb\u25cb .)  Even  if  confidential information  is  not  involved,  when  utilizing  cloud-service  based  generative  AI systems in operations, which are offered to a large, unspecified number of users and accessible  merely  by  agreeing  to  standard  terms  and  conditions  or  rules,  etc., obtaining  approval  for  its  utilization  is  necessary  according  to  the  information security  policy  of  the  Ministry  of \u25cb\u25cb .  Furthermore,  even  if  confidential information is not involved, it is necessary to understand that if, for instance, server equipment is located overseas, where local laws and regulations may apply, and data may be censored or seized by the local governments and authorities.\n\n## (2) Rules During Use\n\n- 1. Rules Regarding Input Data or Prompts\n- \u00b7 Appropriately  utilize  generative  AI  systems  within  the  scope  of  their  intended purpose, considering the risks that may arise from misunderstanding or errors by users.  (Examples:  Utilize  the  generative AI  system  in  accordance  with  the  usage methods  explained  by  the  provider  of  the  generative AI  system  and  refer  to  its manuals as necessary. Avoid utilizing the generative AI system for purposes outside the scope explained by the provider.\n- \u00b7 When  inputting  prompts  containing  personal  information  into  the  generative AI system, confirm in advance whether the input is permissible, and ensure that the utilization  or  provision  of  personal  information  is  minimal  and  necessary  for  the intended purpose. (Example: Properly determine whether users can input prompts including  personal  information  by  checking  the  privacy  policy  or  rules  for  users stipulated by the generative AI system provider of the Ministry of \u25cb\u25cb before using the  generative  AI  system.  If  unsure,  use  prompts  that  do  not  contain  personal information.)\n\n- \u00b7 If administrative organs, etc. input prompts containing retained personal information into  a  generative AI system and the relevant personal information retained in the system is handled for the purposes different from outputting responses to the relevant prompt, the administrative organ may be in violation of the regulations prescribed in the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (Act No. 57 of 2003). Therefore, when entering such prompts, ensure that the provider of the generative AI system does not utilize the retained personal information for machine learning or any other improper purposes.\n- \u00b7 Input accurate and up-to-date data. (Example: Since inaccurate inputs can lead to incorrect responses, users should check whether the information, such as its premise, is accurate or not before inputting data into the generative AI.)\n- 2. Rules Regarding the Utilization of Generated Outputs\n- \u00b7 Recognize  that  decisions  made  based  on  outputs  from  generative AI  should  be accountable.  (Example:  Users  ensure  that  they  can  explain  about  the  generated outputs before utilizing them in their operational tasks. If necessary, rephrase the outputs into expressions that the users can explain by themselves.)\n- \u00b7 Make responsible decisions regarding the uses of generative AI outputs in operations. (Example: Users themselves should determine whether it is appropriate to utilize the outputs of generative AI in operations, taking into consideration the biases that can be  included  in  input  data,  prompts  or  outputs.  If  users  are  unsure  whether  it  is appropriate or not, do not utilize the outputs in operations.)\n- \u00b7 Ensure accuracy, rationale, and factuality of the outputs, taking into consideration the level of associated risks.\n- \u00b7 Ensure there are no issues regarding safety, fairness, objectivity, or neutrality of the outputs. Be sure to edit, omit, or correct any problematic expressions. (Example: Confirm that there is no use of discriminatory words or expressions that violate ethics, infringe third-party's rights such as copyrights, or do harm to / adversely impact on the life, body, or property of third parties.)\n- \u00b7 Properly  deal  with  documents  for  official  duties  created  by  using  generative  in accordance with the Public Records and Archives Management Act (Act No. 66 of 2009). 2\n- \u00b7 Promptly report to the Chief AI Officer (CAIO) at xxx@xxx.go.jp upon detecting\n\n2 Regarding the handling of documents formulated by using generative AI, the \"Notification Regarding Creation and Management of Administrative Documents Using Digital Technologies\" (issued by the Director of the Records and Archives Management Division, the Cabinet Office, on February 14, 2025) states that \"documents formulated by staff of administrative organs by using AI in their official duties (such as draft minutes of councils) are regarded as administrative documents if they are retained for organizational use by the administrative organs. However, it is important to undergo necessary verifications to ensure the accuracy of these documents.\"\n\nsignificant risk cases particular to generative AI systems. (Example: Generative AI outputs results contain prejudice or discrimination related to race, gender, or culture that could pose major social issues.)\n\n## 3. Contact Information\n\nFor inquiries regarding these rules, contact the \u25cb\u25cb (Representative) of the Ministry of \u25cb\u25cb (yyy@yy.go.jp). For inquiries about various generative AI systems, contact the representatives of the respective generative AI system provider. (In cases independent reporting rules are set for the use of specific generative AI systems, comply with those rules.)\n\nEnd of Document\n\n## Overview of this Check Sheet\n\nAppendix 3\n\n## Provisional Translation\n\nThis check sheet organizes the items for evaluating and selecting service providers when procuring generative AI systems.\n\nPlanners should refer to this check sheet when creating procurement specifications for procuring generative AI systems.

Therefore, it is necessary to also refer to the contract templates of each ministry or agency when creating the contract.\n\nIn this check sheet, \"[Appendix 4] Contract Check Sheet (for Generative AI Systems)' is referred to as the \"Contract Check Sheet.\"\n\nBudget Planning Stage\n\nPlanning of Procurement\n\nEvaluation/ Selection\n\nPublic Noticel Examination\n\nContract\n\n## 1. Preparation of the Contract\n\n- Planners prepare the contract\n- Referto the \"Digital Government Promotion Standard Guidelines to ensure that the requirements expected of service providers are clearly specified in documents such as the \"Requirements Definition Document\" and \"Procurement Specifications\" when procuring government information systems\n- Additionally,  incorporate the terms that must be stipulated as contract clauses during the procurement of generative Al systems by referring to this \"Contract Check Sheet\"\n\n## 2. Contract with the Service Provider\n\n- Planners make a contract with service providers\n\nAcceptance Inspection\n\n'In principle, the contracted service provider is responsible for necessary information disclosure and provision. However, if the service provider, as the contracting party, is not able to obtain information disclosure or provision from a third party due to business circumstances, it is also possible to stipulate in the contract with the service provider that information can be directly shared with government staffby the third party.\n\n## Structure of this Check Sheet\n\nClassification of Items for Contracts\n\n| No. of Agreed Term   | Classifiauon of Items for   | Agreed Tems                                             | Example Qauses to be Included in the Contract                                                                                                                             | Supplementary Explanations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                      | Basic Tens                  | [Agreemerts for Inputs Related to Generative Al Systems | input uses , conditions for input Uses, ownership of                                                                                                                      | fdlowing consideraticns ar advisable when stipulating the dauses.

For detailed information, please refer to the main document.\n- \uf06e The General Understanding represents the subcommittee's views on the interpretation of the current Japanese copyright act as of the time of publication. The General Understanding is not legally binding, nor should it be considered as a definite legal assessment of any specific generative AI or related technologies that currently exist.\n\n## Basic Concepts on AI and Copyright\n\n## Basic Concepts of the Japanese Copyright Act\n\n- \uf070 The Japanese Copyright Act aims to strike a balance between protecting the rights and interests of copyright holders and ensuring the smooth exploitation of copyrighted works .\n- \uf070 This concept is also crucial when considering the matters on AI and copyright.\n\n## Background of the Study by the Council\n\n- \uf070 With the rapid development and widespread use of generative AI in recent years, there are concerns about the lack of clarity regarding the relationship between AI and copyright.\n- \uf070 Normally, the provisions of the Copyright Act should be interpreted by the judiciary on a case-by-case basis. However,  there are currently very few court precedents that directly address  the relationship between AI and copyright.\n- \uf070 In order to address these concerns without waiting for court precedents to accumulate, since July 2023, a national council*  composed of experts has discussed how the current Copyright Act should be applied in relation to AI aiming to provide a general understanding of this topic.\n\n## Basic Concepts on AI and Copyright\n\n## Three Perspectives on AI and Copyright\n\n- \uf070 When it comes to AI and copyright, it is important to differentiate between the exploitation of copyrighted works in the 'AI development / training stage' and infringement in the 'generation / utilization stage'.\n\n## AI Development / Training Stage\n\n## Generation / Utilization Stage\n\n- \u00b7 Creating a training data set by collecting and reproducing copyrighted works as training data\n- \u00b7 Generating materials (e.g., images etc.) using AI\n- \u00b7 Developing AI (pre-trained machine learning model) by using such data sets for training\n- \u00b7 Uploading and making public AI-generated images, selling copies of generated images (e.g., publishing art collection books, etc.)\n- \uf070 Moreover, it is also necessary to separately consider whether AI-generated materials (i.e., content generated by AI) are susceptible to copyright protection and can become 'copyrighted works'.\n\n## Main Topics Discussed by the Council\n\n- \uf070 The Council discussed the relationship between AI and copyright, focusing on the concerns of stakeholders such as AI-related businesses, users, creators, and other right holders. The main topics covered during the discussion included the following:\n\n## AI Development / Training Stage\n\n## Generation / Utilization Stage\n\n## Exploitation of copyrighted works for AI development / training etc. \uff08 Article 30-4 etc. \uff09\n\n- \uf06e The 'non-enjoyment purpose' requirement\n- \uf06e Article 30-4 proviso\n\n## Copyright infringement in the generation and utilization of AI-generated materials\n\n- \uf06e Criteria for copyright infringement\n- \uf06e Countermeasures for copyright infringement\n- \uf06e Cases where AI-related businesses are liable for copyright infringement\n\n## Copyrightability of AI-generated Material\n\n## Criteria for determining the copyrightability of AI-generated material\n\n- \uf06e The relationship between the specificity of instructions to the AI and the copyrightability of AI-generated materials\n\n## Overview of the General Understanding\n\n## : AI Development / Training Stage\n\n## Article 30-4 of the Copyright Act\n\n- \uf070 Exploitation of a copyrighted work not for enjoyment of the thoughts or sentiments expressed in the copyrighted work (exploitation for non-enjoyment purposes)* such as AI development or other forms of data analysis may, in principle, be allowed without the permission of the copyright holder. *e.g., collection (i.e. reproduction) of copyrighted works as AI training data\n- \uf070 'Enjoyment' under the Article 30-4 refers to the act of obtaining the benefit of having the viewer's intellectual and emotional needs satisfied through using the copyrighted work.\n\n\u300a Examples of acts that can be called 'enjoyment' \u300b\n\nLiterary works\n\n: To read\n\nWorks of computer programming\n\nMusical works\n\n: To appreciate\n\nMovie works\n\n: To execute\n\n- \uf070 The financial benefits that copyright holders receive from their works are generally considered rewards for meeting intellectual and emotional needs. Meanwhile, the exploitation of works for non-enjoyment purposes, which may occur without the consent of the copyright holder, is generally regarded as not harming the financial interests of the copyright holder. Therefore, in such cases acquiring permission for use of the copyrighted works from the copyright holder is not deemed to be required pursuant to Article 30-4 of the Act.\n\n## Overview of the General Understanding\n\n: AI Development / Training Stage\n\n## Article 30-4 of the Copyright Act\n\n- \uf070 The provisions of Article 30-4 of the Act do not apply to the 'exploitation of works for the purpose of enjoyment'' and the 'exploitation of works where the main purpose is nonenjoyment such as provision for use in data analysis, but where there is also the purpose of enjoyment.*'\n- * The presence or absence of an \"enjoyment\" purpose is determined by 'the work\" exploited under the Article, not by other copyrighted works or not copyrighted elements such as an 'artist's style'.\n- \uf070 Where a work is being used for  \"non-commercial' or \"research purposes\", etc.,  permission from the copyright holder is required where there is also a 'purpose of enjoyment' of the work present.\n- \uf070 Furthermore, Article 30-4 of the Act does not apply in \"cases that would unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright holder.*'\n- \u00b7 e.g., reproducing a copyrighted database work for the purpose of data analysis, such as AI training for which licenses for data analysis are available in the marketplace, etc.\n\n## Overview of the General Understanding\n\n: AI Development / Training Stage\n\n## Article 30-4 of the Copyright Act (Act No. 48 of 1970)\n\n(Exploitation without the Purpose of Enjoying the Thoughts or Sentiments Expressed in a Work)\n\nIt is permissible to exploit a work, in any way and to the extent considered necessary, in any of the following cases, or in any other case in which it is not a person's purpose to personally enjoy or cause another person to enjoy the thoughts or sentiments expressed in that work; provided, however, that this does not apply if the action would unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner in light of the nature or purpose of the work or the circumstances of its exploitation:\n\n- i. if it is done for use in testing to develop or put into practical use technology that is connected with the recording of sounds or visuals of a work or other such exploitation;\n- ii. if it is done for use in data analysis (meaning the extraction, comparison, classification, or other statistical analysis of the constituent language, sounds, images, or other elemental data from a large number of works or a large volume of other such data; the same applies in Article 47-5, paragraph (1), item ii);\n- iii. if it is exploited in the course of computer data processing or otherwise exploited in a way that does not involve what is expressed in the work being perceived by the human senses (for works of computer programming, such exploitation excludes the execution of the work on a computer), beyond as set forth in the preceding two items.\n\n## Overview of the General Understanding\n\n## : AI Development / Training Stage\n\n## Cases not Meeting the 'Non-enjoyment Purpose' Requirement\n\n- \uf070 In the following cases, the reproduction of copyrighted works for AI training does not satisfy the  \"non-enjoyment purpose\" requirement since the 'purpose of enjoyment' is also present, rendering Article 30-4 of the Act inapplicable.\n\n## Exploitation of Works for AI Training (e.g., Collection of AI Training Data)\n\n- \uf0fc The collection of works for AI training to generate materials similar to copyrighted works within the collected works. This is a form of additional training on the foundation model, also known as fine-tuning, and intentional 'overfitting'.\n\n## Exploitation of Works in Situations other than AI Training\n\n- \uf0fc The collection of works as input data to generative AI for implementation of retrieval augmented generation (RAG)*\n\n*Those that aim to output the creative expression (wholly or partially) of a copyrighted work inputted.\n\n- *  Even if Article 30-4 of the Act does not apply, the exploitation of copyrighted works for output by RAG, etc. (and reproduction or public transmission of copyrighted works as a preparatory act for RAG, etc.) may be made without the permission of the right holder as long as the requirements of Article 47-5 of the Act are.\n\n## Overview of the General Understanding\n\n## : AI Development / Training Stage\n\n## Imitation of a 'Creator's Style'\n\n- \uf070 Copyright protection applies to the 'creative expressions' of an idea and not to the 'idea' itself. Therefore, an AI-generated material which applies the \"creator's style\" of a preexisting copyrighted work does not infringe copyright if the style merely encompasses an idea.\n- \uf070 Conversely, Article 30-4 of the Act may not apply to AI training which 'picks off' a specific creator's style in the following situations:\n- \uf06e The distinction between 'ideas' and 'creative expressions' has been determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the specific circumstances.\n- \uf06e A small group of works consisting only of specific creator's copyrighted works may not only have a common 'creator's style' (i.e., idea), but may also include common 'creative expressions.'\n- \uf06e If such a group of works  is intentionally reproduced in order to carry out additional training for the purpose of generating materials that contains all or parts of such common creative expressions, Article 304 of the Act does not apply to such reproduction because the 'purpose of enjoyment' coexists.\n- * In addition, if  AI-generated material applies creative expressions with such group of works described above at the generation / utilization stage, this may constitute  copyright infringement.\n\n## Overview of the General Understanding\n\n## : AI Development / Training Stage\n\n## Article 30-4 Proviso: if unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner\n\n- \uf070 It is necessary to assess the applicability of the Article 30-4 proviso by considering  'whether it will compete in the market with the copyrighted work\" and \"whether it will impede the potential sales channels of the copyrighted work in the future.\" This assessment should be done by taking various factors into account, such as 'technological advancements' and 'changes in the way the copyrighted work is used.' * 1\n- \uf070 The following explains the relationship between the collection of AI training data and this proviso:\n- \uf06e The proviso applies where a copyrighted database work which contains data provided in a format that can be used for information analysis and is available on the internet for a fee was reproduced without compensation.\n- \uf06e In certain cases, it is assumed that there is an intention to commercialize copyrighted database works including website data, that are organized in a format suitable for information analysis. This assumption* 2 arises when, for example, 'technical measures'* 3 have been taken to prevent reproduction of copyrighted works for AI training.'\n- \uf06e In cases where copyrighted database works* 4 are reproduced for AI training while avoiding above mentioned technical measures such reproduction falls within the Article 30-4 proviso.\n- *1  From  'Basic  concepts  regarding  flexible  provisions  on  the  restriction  of  rights  that  respond  to  advancement  in  digitalization  and networking' (PDF, in Japanese), JCO.\n\n*2  In  addition  to  the  below-mentioned  'technical  measures,'  the  past  sales  record  of  database  works  that  can  be  used  for  information analysis, etc.\n\n*3 Measures to prevent web crawlers from collecting AI training data include adding instructions in a file called \"robots.txt\" in the website's root directory or requiring access authentication through ID and password.\n\n*4 Possible methods of reproducing website content include using web crawlers to collect large amounts of data.\n\n## Overview of the General Understanding\n\n## : AI Development / Training Stage\n\n## Reproducing Infringing Copies for AI Training\n\n- \uf070 Collecting AI training data from websites while being aware that they distribute pirated or copyright-infringing content  should be strictly avoided.\n- \uf070 If a business  (i.e., AI developer or AI service provider) knowingly collects AI training data that includes infringing copies, it may be held liable for copyright infringement by the generative AI in the following cases:\n- \uf06e According to legal precedent, a person other than the direct infringer may be liable for copyright infringement.\n- \uf06e If an AI developer or AI service provider collects training data for their AI from a website that they know contains pirated or infringing content, there is a high possibility that the business will be held responsible for any copyright infringement caused by the generative AI developed using the training data taken from the website.\n\n* According to the 'General Understanding', it is  recommended for copyright holders to share information regarding  websites that contain pirated or other infringing copies with the businesses. This way  businesses can identify these  websites and exclude them as a source for data collection for AI training data.\n\n## Overview of the General Understanding\n\n: Generation / Utilization Stage\n\n## Requirements for Copyright Infringement: 'Similarity' and 'Dependence'\n\n- \uf070 When AI-generated images or copies of thereof are uploaded to social media or sold, copyright infringement will be determined based on the same criteria as for normal infringement.\n- \uf070 In other words, if an AI-generated image or any other creation is found  to have similarity (i.e., common creative expression) and dependence (i.e., creation based on existing copyrighted work) with an existing image, etc. (copyrighted work), and there are no applicable copyright exceptions, it will be considered an infringement of copyright.\n- \uf070 If an AI product does not have \"similarity\" or 'dependence\" with a preexisting copyrighted work, it does not constitute copyright infringement of the copyright in that work. According to the Copyright Act, it then is possible to use the copyrighted work without the permission of the copyright holder. Additionally, permission is not required for uses falling within copyright exceptions, such as the act of creating and viewing images for personal use (i.e., reproduction for private use).\n\n## Overview of the General Understanding\n\n## : Generation / Utilization Stage\n\n## 'Dependency' in the Case of Generation by AI\n\n- \uf070 The requirements for finding copyright infringement include the elements \"similarity\" and 'dependency.\" In the case of  AI generated content dependency can be explained  as follows:\n\n## When It Is Unknown whether the Existing Copyrighted Work is Used for AI Training\n\n- \uf06e If it is uncertain whether a particular copyrighted material is used in the AI training data, dependency will be presumed if the copyright holder can prove that \"the AI user had access to the existing copyrighted work\" or \"the AI-generated material has a high degree of similarity with the work'. This means that it is possible for the copyright holder to establish dependency even though it is unknown whether the AI has used the work during AI training.\n\n## When the Copyright Holder can Prove the Existing Copyrighted Work is Used for AI Training\n\n- \uf06e It is generally assumed that there was  dependency on a preexisting copyrighted work, even if the  user of an AI was not aware of it*, if the work was used for AI training during the development stage of that AI.\n- *  However, if the generative AI \"does not output the creative expression of the copyrighted work used for AI training at the generation / utilization stage\", it may be judged that there is no dependency.\n- 13 \uf070 It is important to remember that while AI can legally 'generate materials', caution should be exercised when 'using the generated materials', such as uploading them to social media platforms. Just because the materials were generated legally does not necessarily mean they can be used legally in all situations and the legality* of each specific situation needs to be assessed and determined. * e.g., whether or not copyright exceptions apply\n\n## Overview of the General Understanding\n\n: Generation / Utilization Stage\n\n## Countermeasures for Copyright Infringement\n\n- \uf070 In case of copyright infringement, the copyright holder of existing works can take following countermeasures: *1\n- \uf06e The copyright holder may seek injunctive relief against the party that infringes on their copyright by using generative AI. This injunction may include 'prohibiting the creation of new infringing material' as well as the 'use of infringed works already created.' Additionally, the copyright holder  may request the destruction  of AI-generated materials that were created as a result of the infringement.\n- \uf06e In certain cases, *2  the copyright holder may request that the infringing material be removed from the AI training dataset used for development of the generative AI that created it.\n- \uf06e Furthermore, in certain circumstances, *3  the copyright holder may request from the AI developer and/or the AI service provider that appropriate measures *4  are taken to prevent copyright infringement caused by the  generative AI.\n- *1 The exact measures that may be taken in response to copyright claims will be determined by a court, considering their necessity and other relevant factors.\n- *2  I.e., if an AI developer is responsible for copyright infringement related to the creation and application of their product, and there is a high probability that the dataset utilized for the development of the generative AI which produced the infringing product could also be used for AI development in the future.\n- *3  I.e., in cases where an AI developer or AI service provider is liable for copyright infringement arising from the generation and use of a product and where there is a high probability that further infringing material will be generated by the generative AI that produced the infringing product.\n- 14 *4 For instance, there are certain ways to limit the technical capabilities of generative AI. This includes: 1.) implementing measures to prevent the AI from generating outputs based on certain inputs or 2.) inhibiting the creation of similar materials that may infringe on copyrighted works used for the AI's training.\n\n## Overview of the General Understanding\n\n## : Generation / Utilization Stage\n\n## Cases in which AI-related businesses are liable for copyright infringement\n\n- \uf070 Based on current judicial precedents, it is possible for both AI users and businesses that develop or provide AI services to be held liable for copyright infringement related to AIgenerated materials. Liability for copyright infringement will depend on various factors.\n\n## Factors that Increase the Likelihood that Businesses will be Held Liable\n\n- \uf0fc A particular generative AI tends to produce materials that infringe on copyright laws frequently.\n- \uf0fc In developing and providing generative AI, the business has not taken measures to prevent the generative AI from generating copyright infringing materials, despite recognizing that it is highly likely to do so.\n\n## Factors that Reduce the Likelihood that Businesses will be Held Liable\n\n- \uf0fc The business has taken measures to prevent the generative AI from generating copyright infringing materials in developing and providing generative AI.\n- *  In addition, If a generative AI is not designed to produce copyrighted materials at a high rate, but such materials are created due to malicious instructions from a user, it is unlikely that the business will be held liable for infringement. This, however, only applies where  the generative AI is in a state where it does not generate infringing materials at a high rate.\n\n## Overview of the General Understanding\n\n: Copyrightability of AI-generated Material\n\n## Copyrightability of AI-generated Material\n\n- \uf070 According to the Copyright Act, a (copyrighted) 'work' is defined as a 'creatively produced expression of thoughts or sentiments that falls within the literary, academic, artistic, or musical domain.'\n- \uf070 Materials autonomously generated by AI* are not \"creatively produced expressions of thoughts or sentiments\" and are therefore not considered  (copyrighted) 'works.'\n- *i.e., material that is generated by AI without any instructions from humans (or only by giving simple instructions as prompt (e.g., 'Draw a cat.'))\n- \uf070 On the other hand, if  AI is used as a \"tool' by a person to creatively express thoughts or sentiments, such  material is considered a 'work', and the user of the AI the 'author'.\n- * Please note that only a person (i.e., a natural  or legal person) can be an \"author\" under the Copyright Act. An AI itself, which does not have a legal personality, cannot be an author.\n- \uf070 Determining whether a person has used AI as a \"tool\" depends on two factors: whether the person had a \"creative intention\" and whether the person has made a \"creative contribution\".\n\n## Overview of the General Understanding\n\n## : Copyrightability of AI-generated Material\n\nRelationship between the specificity of instructions given to an AI and the copyrightability of AI-generated materials\n\n- \uf070 The following outlines under which circumstances AI products are recognized as containing the  AI user's 'creative contributions.' *1\n- \uf06e The copyrightability of AI-generated content will be determined on a case-by-case basis. * 2\n- \uf06e Specifically, it is assessed through a comprehensive consideration of the extent of creative contributions that surpass mere effort.\n\n## Examples of factor in determining copyrightability of AI-generated material\n\n- \uf0fc Amount of instructions/input: 'Detailed instructions that specifically indicate what constitutes creative expression' are more likely to be considered as creative contributions. However, lengthy instructions (i.e., prompts)  that merely suggest an idea do not influence the assessment of creative contribution.\n- \uf0fc Number of generation attempts: A large number of attempts alone does not affect the assessment of creative contribution. Repeated attempts, while checking the generated materials and correcting the instructions/input, may be recognized as a creative contribution.\n- \uf0fc Selection from multiple output materials: The mere act of selection itself does not influence the determination of creative contribution. However, certain elements of choice may be involved which may be considered as creative.\n- \uf06e In addition, any additions or corrections made by humans to AI-generated materials that can be considered creative expressions are generally considered to be copyrighted works.\n\n*1 The issues of 'whether an AI-generated work can be copyrighted or not' and 'whether generation by AI or the usage of AI-generated materials constitutes the copyright infringement' need to be separately. Even if an AI-generated material is copyrighted, it can still constitute copyright infringement of the existing copyrighted work, if it meets the necessary requirements for infringement.\n\n*2 Hence, whether or not an AI product corresponds to a copyrighted work is not solely determined by \"the fact that it is an AI product\".\n\n## Outlook for the Future\n\n## Continued Information Gathering and Discussion\n\n- \uf070 The General Understanding is a summary of the Council's tentative consensus about AI and copyright. The Council will continue to gather information on topics such as the \"collection of legal precedents on AI and copyright,\" the \"development of AI and related technologies,\" the \"progress of research on AI and copyright in other countries,\" and more. As necessary, the Council will consider revising the General Understanding.\n- \uf070 JCO will actively continue to collect examples of  AI copyright infringement cases (including suspected cases) through the consultation desks for the public.*\n- \uf070 The discussion within the General Understanding mainly focused on the relationship between AI and copyright (i.e., property rights). However, it is important to consider if there are any other aspects that need to be taken into account independently. It is also necessary to explore how AI intersects with moral and related rights, including the use of performances/records that feature the voices of actors/voice actors.\n\n\u203b The consultation desks for the public set up by the Agency for Cultural Affairs, Japan are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Consultation desk for countermeasures against copyright infringement due to pirated copies sold on the Internet https://www.bunka.go.jp/seisaku/chosakuken/kaizoku/index.html\n- \u00b7 Legal consultation desk regarding cultural and artistic activities https://www.bunka.go.jp/seisaku/bunka_gyosei/kibankyoka/madoguchi/index.html\n\n## Outlook for the Future\n\n## Effective communication between relevant parties\n\n- \uf070 To ensure the implementation of  good practices in the intersection of AI and copyright, it is important to facilitate not only legal discussions but also effective communication among relevant parties involved in AI and copyright matters, such copyright holders (i.e. creators), AI developers, AI service providers, and AI users.\n- \uf070 Generative AI technology is thus far built upon the creative activities of humankind. If the sustainability of human creativity is compromised, the sustainable development of generative AI technology becomes unattainable. Hence, it is hoped that a mutually beneficial relationship fostering a fruitful content creation environment and cultural development will be established between generative AI and its associated businesses, as well as creators.\n- \uf070 Establishing appropriate rules and guidelines between involved parties based on current legal interpretations will be essential as a foundation for future discussions. This entails fostering a common understanding among the relevant parties, particularly regarding a correct understanding of generative AI and related technologies and mechanisms, as well as the sentiments of creators and other copyright holders concerning the use of their copyrighted works.\n- \uf070 JCO, in collaboration with other relevant ministries and agencies, will continue its efforts to facilitate effective communication among the involved parties and to promote best practices in the intersection of AI and copyright.", "metadata": {"country": "Japan", "year": 2024, "legally_binding": "no", "binding_proof": NaN, "date": "NaT", "regulator": "Japan Copyright Office (JCO)", "type": NaN, "status": "enacted", "language": "English", "use_cases": "[1,2,3,4,5,6]"}}
