Foreword \nThe increasing applications of AI1 in financial services have benefitted \nfinancial institutions in the provision of customer service. However new \nrisks, problems, and supervision challenges have also arisen. To help \nfinancial institutions make the most of AI technology while effectively \nmanaging risks, ensuring fairness, protecting consumer interests, \nmaintaining system security, and achieving sustainability, the Financial \nSupervisory Commission (FSC), based on the Executive Yuan's \"AI \nTaiwan Action Plan 2.0\" and promotion strategies determined in the \n\"Special Meeting for Coordination of Digital Policies and Legislation,\" and \nin reference to the relevant guiding principles issued by the financial \nsupervisory authorities of major countries and international organizations, \nand taking into consideration the development status of our financial \nmarket and the directions of FSC supervisory policy, has formulated six \ncore principles for AI applications tailored to our financial sector. These \nprinciples seek to steer financial institutions toward actively investing in \ntechnological innovation and bringing about financial service upgrade \nunder the premise that consumer interests, the order of the financial market, \nand social responsibility are also taken into account. \nBelow are descriptions of the impacts of AI and the positions and rules \nof international organizations or major countries on AI, the current status \nof AI application in Taiwan's financial sector, the necessity of formulating \nAI principles and policies, six core principles for AI applications in our \nfinancial sector, and the FSC's supporting policies for the development and \npromotion of AI. \n2.Impacts of AI and the positions and rules of international \norganizations or major countries on AI \n2.1 Advantages of AI technology and potential issues \n \n1 Given the continuous advancements in AI, international organizations and governments around the \nworld have not defined AI, but rather focus on \"AI systems.\" This paper will use the term \"AI\" and \"AI \nsystem\" alternately. According to the definition of The Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD), \"AI system\" is a machine-based system that can, for a given set of objectives, \ngenerate outputs (e.g. predictions, recommendations or decisions) to influence the environments. It uses \nmachine- or human- based data and inputs to (1) perceive real or virtual environment; (2) abstract such \nperceptions into models through automated analysis (e.g. use machine learning) or human analysis; and \n(3) use model inference to formulate options for information or action. Different AI systems are designed \nwith different levels of autonomy after deployment. \n \n \n \n2 \n \nThe development of AI technology is expected to bring enormous \neconomic and social benefits, which will be demonstrated in many \ndifferent areas, including the environment, health, the public sector, \nfinance, transportation, domestic affairs, and agriculture. As AI utilizes \nmassive data and computing power, it is particularly useful for improving \nprediction, optimizing operations and resource allocation, and customizing \nservices, thereby benefiting mankind tremendously. \nHowever, AI systems also raise new ethical issues that may influence the \nvalue and lives of mankind. Thus AI should be used with caution, for issues \narising from the use of AI may have implications regarding decision-\nmaking, labor and employment, social interactions, healthcare, education, \nmedia, access to information, the digital divide, personal data and \nconsumer protection, the environment, democracy, rule of law, security and \nlaw enforcement, and human rights and fundamental freedoms (including \nfreedom of expression, privacy, and non-discrimination). In addition, AI \nmay accentuate those ethical challenges. That is because AI algorithms can \nreplicate and amplify existing biases, thereby exacerbating existing forms \nof discrimination, prejudice, and stereotyping. Previously when certain \nproblems were handled by humans, it was easier to control situations. But \nan AI system is capable of executing tasks rapidly. In the absence of proper \ndesign and control, it could be perilous when AI performs certain tasks for \nhumans and unforeseen circumstances arise. \nMoreover, the rapid evolution of generative AI2 in recent years and its \nextensive impact on many fields are regarded as a major breakthrough for \nAI. The introduction of generative AI may help boost production efficiency \nand provide a wide variety of functions and services. But it may also \ninvolve personal data leaks, privacy issues, information security risks, and \nother legal risks. The capability of generative AI to create new content \nrapidly might create massive amounts of questionable or false information, \nthereby raising concern about the spread of false information. \nIn a long-term perspective, the use of AI systems, in particular \ngenerative AI that enables the creation of customized texts and images \nbased on personal preferences, could challenge humans' special sense of \nexperience and agency, thereby raising additional concerns about human \nself-understanding, social, cultural, and environmental interaction, \nautonomy, agency, worth, and dignity. \n \n \n2 According to Article 28b(4) of EU's Artificial Intelligence Act proposal, generative AI is defined as \n\"AI systems specifically intended to generate with varying levels of autonomy, content such as complex \ntext, images, audio or video.\" \n3 \n \n2.2 Positions of international organizations and major countries on AI \nIn light of the rapid development of AI in recent years, major \norganizations are paying increasing attention to AI. Those organizations \nalso call on members to include their recommendations in their policies, \nregulations, and measures. In the Recommendation on the Ethics of AI3 \nreleased by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization (UNESCO) in 2021, it identifies \"respecting, protecting and \npromoting human rights and fundamental freedoms, and human dignity\" \nas core values and recommends ten principles - \"proportionality and do not \nharm,\" \"safety and security,\" \"fairness and non-discrimination,\" \n\"sustainability,\" \"right to privacy and data protection,\" \"human oversight \nand determination,\" \"transparency and explainability,\" \"responsibility and \naccountability,\" \"awareness and literacy,\" and \"multi-stakeholder and \nadaptive governance and collaboration\" for reference in every policy area. \nThe \"AI Principles\"4 published by The Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) in 2019 promote the use of AI that is \n\"innovative and trustworthy and that respects human rights and democratic \nvalues,\" and recommend five values-based principles \u2013 \"inclusive growth, \nsustainable development and well-being,\" \"human-centric values and \nfairness,\" \"transparency and explainability,\" \"robustness, security and \nsafety,\" and \"accountability\" for adoption by policymakers. \nThe G7 Digital and Tech Ministers' Meeting 5  held in April 2023 \ndeclares an agreement on five principles for developing emerging \ntechnologies \u2013 \"rule of law,\" \"due process,\" \"democracy,\" \"respect for \nhuman rights,\" and \"utilizing opportunities for innovation.\" \nThe United States passed the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative \nAct of 20206 in 2020, and enacted it in 2021. The Act seeks to ensure \ncontinued US leadership in AI research and development, lead the world \nin the use of trustworthy AI systems in the public and private sectors, \nprepare the present and future US workforce for the integration of AI \nsystems, and coordinate ongoing AI activities among departments of the \nfederal government. The White House published the Blueprint for an AI \nBill of Rights 7 , which outlines five principles \u2013 \"safe and effective \nsystems,\" \"algorithmic discrimination protections,\" \"data privacy,\" \"notice \nand explanation,\" and \"human alternatives, consideration and fallback\" to \n \n3 Please refer to https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380455 \n4 Please refer to https://oecd.ai/en/ai-principles \n5 Please refer to https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/G-7-ministers-agree-to-five-principles-\nfor-assessing-AI-risks \n6 Please refer to https://www.congress.gov/116/crpt/hrpt625/CRPT-116hrpt617.pdf#page=1210 \n7 Please refer to https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/ \n4 \n \nguide the design, use, and deployment of AI automated systems to protect \nthe American public. \nThe European Council passed the draft Artificial Intelligence Act8 in \nJune 2023 to ensure that Europe develops and uses AI in a manner \nconsistent with the rights and values of the EU. The Act classifies the risks \nof AI systems into four categories - \"unacceptable risk,\" \"high risk,\" \n\"limited risk,\" and \"minimal risk,\" and adopts corresponding measures of \n\"prohibited AI practices,\" \"regulatory control,\" \"transparency,\" and \"no \nlegal obligations\" based on the level of risk. For instance, AI practices that \nare considered to be a clear threat to humans\u2019 livelihoods and rights, such \nas social scoring, which present \"unacceptable risk,\" are banned. For AI \nsystems that might create adverse impact on humans\u2019 fundamental rights \nor safety, such as access to private essential services, which present \"high \nrisk,\" such a service provider must first undergo a conformity assessment \ntest and register with the EU before it is put on the market (existing service \nproviders are regulated by existing law), and must comply with a range of \nrequirements on risk management, testing, technical robustness, data \ntraining and data governance, transparency, human oversight, and \ncybersecurity. AI systems presenting limited risk, such as systems that \ninteract with humans (i.e. chatbots), emotion recognition systems, \nbiometric categorization systems, and AI systems that generate or \nmanipulate images and audio or video content (i.e. deepfakes) would be \nsubject to a set of transparency regulations. AI systems presenting minimal \nrisk, such as email filtering software, could be developed and used in the \nEU without conforming to any additional legal obligations. However, the \nEU will create codes of conduct for the reference of businesses. \nTaiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology 9  drafted the \"AI \nTechnology R&D Guidelines\" in September 2019. These Guidelines \nidentify the core values of \"human-centered values,\" \"sustainable \ndevelopment,\" and \"diversity and inclusion,\" and take into consideration \nthe academic freedom of AI researchers to encourage AI innovation, \nuphold human rights and universal values, and perfect the domestic AI \nR&D environment. The Guidelines set out eight principles, including \n\"Common Good and Well-being,\" \"Fairness and Non-discrimination,\" \n\"Autonomy and Control,\" \"Safety,\" \"Privacy and Data Governance,\" \n\"Transparency and Traceability,\" \"Explainability,\" and \"Accountability and \nCommunication.\" \nThe Executive Yuan approved and published the \"AI Taiwan Action Plan \n \n8 Please refer to \nhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/698792/EPRS_BRI(2021)698792_EN.pdf \n9 Please refer to https://www.nstc.gov.tw/nstc/attachments/53491881-eb0d-443f-9169-1f434f7d33c7 \n5 \n \n2.0\" in April 2023, which declares the visions of \"Use AI to drive industrial \ntransformation and upgrading, use AI to help improve social well-being, \nand turn Taiwan a global vanguard of AI.\" The Action Plan 2.0 also lays \nout the tasks of starting with individual industries to bring about the \ntransformation and upgrade of all industries, building a trustworthy AI \nenvironment that puts equal emphasis on technological innovation and risk \ngovernance, being prepared for social impacts brought about by AI, \ndeveloping an inclusive digital economy with AI, and addressing major \nchallenges faced by society to enhance the well-being of all humans. \n2.3 Supervisory recommendations of international organizations and major \ncountries on AI applications in the financial sector \nAI has come into increasing use in financial services in recent years. \nWhile the implementation of AI has created benefits for the financial sector, \nincluding better service efficiency, lower cost of services, and an enhanced \ncustomer experience, it has also created new risks and supervisory \nchallenges regarding such possibilities as personal data leaks, privacy \nbreaches, ethical concerns, and workforce transformation. Thus, the \nquestion of how to make sure financial institutions can effectively manage \nrisks, ensure fairness, protect consumer interests, maintain system security, \nand achieve sustainable development while using AI is an issue that \nfinancial supervisory authorities and financial institutions must address. \nThe Financial Stability Board (FSB) published the \"Artificial \nintelligence and machine learning in financial services\u2014Market \ndevelopments and financial stability implications\"10 in 2017, which relates \nthat AI and machine learning (ML) can help financial institutions process \ninformation and data more efficiently, and the adoption of regulatory \ntechnology (RegTech) and supervisory technology (SupTech) can help \nimprove regulatory compliance and increase supervisory effectiveness. \nThe FSB also points out the following risks associated with AI and ML: \n(1)Network effects and scalability of new technologies may in the future \ngive rise to third-party dependencies. This could in turn lead to the \nemergence of new systemically important players that could fall \noutside the regulatory perimeter. \n(2)Applications of AI and ML could result in new and unexpected forms \nof interconnectedness between financial markets and institutions, \nbecause of the use by various institutions of previously unrelated data \nsources. \n(3)The lack of interpretability or auditability of AI and ML methods \n \n10 Please refer to https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P011117.pdf \n6 \n \ncould become a macro-level risk. Similarly, a widespread use of \nopaque models may result in unintended consequences. \nThe FSB advises that it is important to assess uses of AI and ML in view \nof their risks, including adherence to relevant protocols on data privacy, \nconduct risks, and cybersecurity. Adequate testing and training of tools \nwith unbiased data and feedback mechanisms is important to ensure that \napplications can function as expected. \nThe Financial Stability Institute (FSI) under the Bank for International \nSettlements (BIS) released \"Humans Keeping AI in check\u2014emerging \nregulatory expectations in the financial sector\" 11  in 2021. The paper \nclassifies AI systems used by financial institutions into two categories \u2013 \ncustomer-facing and non customer-facing. In the customer-facing category, \nAI systems are further divided into two types based on their impact on \ncustomers \u2013 low impact (e.g. chatbots) and high impact (e.g. credit scoring); \nin the non customer-facing category, AI systems are also further divided \ninto two types, depending on whether supervisory approval is required - \nsupervisory approval not required (e.g. internal operating processes) and \nsupervisory approval required (e.g. regulatory capital adequacy \nassessment). It is hoped that financial supervisory authorities will set forth \nsupervisory measures based on four principles \u2013 \"transparency,\" \n\"reliability and soundness,\" \"accountability,\" and \"fairness and ethics,\" and \nat the same time, address possible challenges through proportionality. \nThe International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) \nreleased \"The Use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning by \nMarket Intermediaries and Asset Managers\"12 in 2021, which proposes six \nmeasures that financial supervisory authorities can adopt, including \nrequiring financial institutions to: (1) have appropriate governance, \ncontrols and oversight frameworks; (2) monitor the development, testing, \nuse and performance monitoring of AI and ML on a continuous basis; (3) \nmake sure that staff have adequate knowledge, skills and experience to \nimplement, oversee, and challenge the outcomes of AI and ML; (4) \nunderstand their reliance on the third-party providers of AI and ML \nservices, and establish sound management and oversight mechanisms; (5) \nprovide proper transparency and disclose information to investors, \nregulators and stakeholders; and (6) have appropriate controls in place to \nensure that the data and the performance of the AI and ML can minimize \nbias. \n \n11 Please refer to https://www.bis.org/fsi/publ/insights35.pdf \n12 Please refer to https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD684.pdf \n7 \n \nThe financial supervisory authorities of the United States13, Singapore14, \nSouth Korea15, and many other countries have set out relevant guidelines \nand principles, which mostly emphasize \"fairness and ethics,\" \n\"transparency,\" \"accountability,\" \"consumer interests and privacy \nprotection,\" and \"security and robustness.\" \n3.Current status of AI adoption in Taiwan's financial sector, the \nnecessity of formulating AI principles and policies \n3.1 AI or generative AI applications in Taiwan's financial sector \nAccording to a survey of 175 financial institutions in Taiwan conducted \nby the FSC in May 2023, 63 of them (36%) have adopted AI technology \nfor use in (1) customer relationship management, such as smart customer \nservice and robo-advisor services; (2) risk management and compliance, \nincluding money laundering prevention, analysis of suspicious transactions, \nand account opening review; (3) process improvement, including optical \ncharacter recognition (OCR) and backend process automation; (4) data \nanalysis, such as customer attributes and consumption behavior analysis, \nmarket trend analysis, etc.; and (5) others, such as using threat intelligence \nto analyze security scenarios. \nIn addition, to understand the use of ChatGPT or other generative AI by \nTaiwan's financial institutions, the FSC completed a questionnaire survey \nin April 2023. The survey finds that currently no financial institutions use \ngenerative AI in financial services or internal operations. However two \ninstitutions are planning the implementation of AI, while 80 financial \ninstitutions and self-regulatory organizations are evaluating the \nintroduction of AI. \nAnother 95 financial institutions and self-regulatory organizations have \nimplemented control over the use of generative AI by employees, including \nthe setup of firewalls to block intranet connection to ChatGPT and putting \nin place internal rules to prevent the leakage of customer data. \nIn the future, the FSC will continue to communicate with financial \ninstitutions regarding the use of generative AI, and evaluate and adjust \nrelevant rules in view of industry's development status and applications to \nfacilitate compliance by financial institutions. \n3.2 FSC legislation for implementation of emerging technologies by \n \n13 Please refer to https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-\nfiles/AI%20principles%20as%20Adopted%20by%20the%20TF_0807.pdf \n14 Please refer to https://www.mas.gov.sg/-\n/media/mas/resource/news_room/press_releases/2018/annex-a-summary-of-the-feat-principles.pdf \n15 Please refer to https://www.fsc.go.kr/eng/pr010101/76209 \n8 \n \nfinancial institutions \n3.2.1 Banking industry: \n(1)In response to the development of new technologies, the FSC has \napproved the amended Operating Rules for the Use of Emerging \nTechnologies by Financial Institutions in April 2020 to help banks \nmanage risks associated with new technologies and promote the \nsound operation of banking business, including the security \nmanagement of cloud services, social media management procedures, \nsecurity management of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), and \nsecurity management of biometric data. \n(2)With regard to the prevention of AI deepfakes, the FSC has instructed \nthe Bankers Association in its Standards for the Security \nManagement of Electronic Banking Business of Financial \nInstitutions to require that when a bank uses video conference in its \nelectronic banking business, it shall make sure it is the customer, a \nreal person, who appears in the video to prevent fake identity through \nthe use of pre-recorded film, masking, simulated imaging, or \ndeepfake, and retain an authentication record and transaction trail to \nfacilitate verification. The FSC has also instructed the Bankers \nAssociation to include AI use in self-regulatory rules for banks. \n3.2.2 Securities and futures industry: \n(1)Preventing the use of AI deepfake technology in the creation of fake \nidentities: The FSC in September 2022 approved amended \ninformation security self-regulatory rules for emerging technologies \ndrafted by the Securities Association and Futures Association that \nincludes the prevention of deepfakes. The amended rules require that \nwhen a securities/futures enterprise uses video imaging for identity \nverification, it shall also use a one-time password (OTP), a phone call, \nor an in-person visit and check the photograph on identity documents \nfor enhanced verification. Securities/futures enterprises are also \nadvised to carry out education and training on deepfake awareness \nand information security to shore up their risk management of \nemerging technologies. The existing rules will be reviewed in a \ntimely manner in view of AI development. \n(2)Enhancing the supervision of automated investment services to \nsafeguard the interests of investors: The current regulations require \nthat if an investment consulting firm offers automated investment \nservices, it should put in place effective supervision and management \nwith regard to whether the algorithmic design is logical and whether \n9 \n \nthe computing results are accurate, conduct preliminary evaluation \nand periodic review, and assign personnel to monitor the system \noperation to safeguard the interests of investors. The regulations also \nrequire investment consulting firms or their group enterprises to set \nup a committee in charge of supervising and managing the \ndevelopment and modification of algorithms, or participating in the \nreview and onsite investigation of external software developers so as \nto evaluate the adequacy of system design and ensure that the firm \nhas constructed comprehensive prevention, detection, and handling \nmeasures for network security. \n3.2.3 Insurance industry: \nIn response to the development of Fintech, the FSC has been promoting \nthe application of new technologies (e.g. AI, blockchain, biometrics) in \ninsurance products and services and has drafted related supervisory \nregulations, such as the Directions for Insurance Enterprises Engaging in \nElectronic Commerce Business, Directions for Insurance Companies \nProviding Distance Insurance Underwriting and Services, and compliance \nmatters and self-regulatory rules for all kinds of businesses, which require \ninsurance enterprises to implement information security (including \nobtaining ISO 27001 certification for their Information Security \nManagement System and Personal Information Management System), \nmoney laundering control, personal data protection, protection of customer \ninterests, and including those activities in their internal control systems to \nfacilitate compliance by insurance enterprises. \n3.3 The necessity for the FSC to draft AI principles and guidance \nFrom a tech-neutral standpoint, financial institutions still need to comply \nwith the prevailing financial regulations and market self-regulatory rules \nwhen using AI in their operations. However issues such as ethics, fairness, \nprivacy, and transparency may arise in the application of AI technology. To \nensure that associated risks are fully addressed in the prevailing regulations, \nit is necessary to draft a set of principles and policies in conformance with \nthe recommendations of international organizations so as to ensure the use \nof AI will bring only positive benefits to society, the economy, and \nconsumers. \nIn reference to the supervisory principles and guidelines of international \norganizations and major countries for AI and ML, and in consideration of \nAI practices in finance, possible issues arising therefrom, and the \ndevelopment status of our financial market, the FSC has drafted six core \nprinciples for use of AI in the financial sector. It is hoped that those six \nprinciples can guide financial institutions in the innovation and practice of \n10 \n \nAI applications while ensuring that AI can be beneficial to maintaining the \nstability of financial systems and safeguarding the interests of consumers. \nThe FSC will subsequently draft guidelines based on those six core \nprinciples for the reference of and compliance by financial institutions. In \nthe future, the FSC will carry out rolling evaluations and adjustments in \nview of technological developments and the use status of AI systems in our \nfinancial market to keep abreast of the times and meet practical \ndevelopment needs. \n4. Six core principles for AI applications in the financial sector \nIn reference to the guiding principles developed by international \norganizations or the supervisory authorities of major countries for the use \nof AI in financial services, and taking into account the supervisory \nprinciples of \"responsible innovation,\" \"enhancing compliance,\" \"treating \ncustomers \nfairly,\" \n\"financial \ninclusion,\" \n\"information \nsecurity,\" \n\"information disclosure,\" \"sustainable finance,\" and \"caring for \nemployees,\" the FSC proposes the following six core principles for use of \nAI in the financial sector: \n4.1 Core Principle 1: Establishing governance and accountability \nmechanisms (corresponding to the supervisory principle of \n\"responsible innovation\") \n(1)Financial \ninstitutions \nshould \nbear \ninternal \nand \nexternal \nresponsibilities corresponding to the AI systems they use. Internal \nresponsibilities include assigning a senior executive to be responsible \nfor related oversight and management, and establishing an internal \ngovernance \nframework; \nexternal \nresponsibilities \ninvolve \nresponsibilities to consumers and the society, including protecting \nconsumer privacy and data security. \n(2)Financial institutions should establish a comprehensive and effective \nAI risk management mechanism, integrate it into prevailing risk \nmanagement and internal control operations or processes, and \nconduct periodic evaluation and testing. \n(3)Financial institutions should ensure that their employees have \nadequate knowledge and skills to work with AI, and carry out risk-\nbased decision making and supervision. \nDescription: \nThe FSC has adopted the strategy of promoting \"responsible innovation\" \nto encourage the use of technology to develop innovative financial \nproducts or services. On the other hand, the FSC emphasizes the \n11 \n \nimportance of financial market order and consumer protection to make sure \nfinancial innovation poses controllable risks and will have a positive effect \non financial market stability. Against this backdrop, the FSC has proposed \nthe principle of \"establishing governance and accountability mechanisms,\" \nstressing that financial institutions should be responsible for internal \ngovernance and consumer protection when applying AI systems, and \nshould oversee the risk management and use of AI systems. This is to \nensure that while pursuing innovation, financial institutions should also \nfulfill their commitment to social responsibility and strive to build a stable \nand fair financial market environment. \nThe principle of \"establishing governance and accountability \nmechanisms\" is of utmost importance to the use of AI systems by financial \ninstitutions. The spirit of this principle lies in the conviction that financial \ninstitutions should be responsible, both internally and externally, for the \nuse of AI systems. As such, financial institutions must establish a sound \ninternal governance framework in documented form, assign a senior officer \nto take charge of related supervision and management, explicitly define the \nduties of respective lines of business, and ensure the retention of records. \nThese measures help ensure the normal operation of AI systems and \ndiscover and resolve potential problems in a timely manner. \nThe responsibilities of financial institutions with regard to the use of AI \nsystems also cover consumers and social responsibilities. That is, the use \nof AI systems must fully respect and protect the privacy of consumers and \ninformation security. This is not only basic protection of consumer interests, \nbut also paramount to maintaining the business reputation and stable \noperations of the financial institution. \nFinancial institutions must establish an effective AI-related risk \nmanagement mechanism using a risk-based approach, and integrate it into \ntheir overall risk management and internal control operations and \nprocesses. In addition, after its AI system goes online, a financial institution \nshould conduct regular evaluation and testing, including documenting and \nmonitoring situations unforeseen at the time of system development, and if \nnecessary, should modify the system to make sure the AI system is secure \nand effective. \nLastly, this principle also emphasizes the importance of cultivating and \nenhancing employees' AI knowledge and risk identification and \nmanagement skills, and taking a risk-based approach to decision making \nand supervision. As AI technology advances, the knowledge and skills of \nemployees (including those engaged in development, testing, supervision, \ncompliance, risk management, and internal auditing) will have a direct \nbearing on whether the financial institution is able to make proper \n12 \n \ndecisions and effectively supervise the operations of AI systems. Thus \nfinancial institutions should conduct education and training on an ongoing \nbasis to make sure employees are capable of adapting to the rapid growth \nand evolution of AI technology and appropriately addressing related risks \nand challenges. \n4.2 Core Principle 2: Emphasizing fairness and human-centered \nvalues (corresponding to the supervisory principle of \"treating \ncustomers fairly and improving financial inclusion\") \n(1)Financial institutions should, in the process of utilizing AI systems, \ntry their best to avoid unfairness resulting from algorithmic bias. \n(2)The application of AI systems should be human-centric and \ncontrollable by humans, and should respect the rule of law and \ndemocratic values. \n(3)Risks associated with information produced by generative AI must be \nobjectively and professionally controlled by financial institution \npersonnel16. \nDescription: \nThe principle of \"emphasizing fairness and human-centered values\" is \nvital during the process of AI system implementation. Financial institutions \nthat introduce AI systems should recognize fully and try their best to avoid \npotential algorithmic bias. Especially when providing customer-facing AI \nservices, financial institutions must ensure the appropriateness of data \nsources and the quality of data, and conduct testing and validate the \nalgorithm in an independent environment prior to formal launch to avoid \nunintended consequences. Financial institutions should also strive to \nprovide all customers with fair and non-discriminatory financial services \nto achieve financial inclusion. In addition, the data, database, and models \nof an AI system should be subject to regular review and accuracy \nverification to reduce bias. \nIn addition, human-centered and human-controllable values and \napplications are facets that must be taken into consideration when financial \ninstitutions use AI systems. Aside from respecting consumer privacy \nduring the use of AI systems, financial institutions must make sure \nuniversal values such as the rule of law and democracy are also respected, \nand must put into place mechanisms to ensure that AI system evolve in \nsuch a way as to maintain the initial intent of system creation, that is, to \nassist humans without causing harm to humans while ensuring human \n \n16 In reference to Point 2 of the draft of \"Reference Guidelines for the Use of Generative AI by \nExecutive Yuan and Subordinate Agencies (Institutions).\" \n13 \n \nautonomy and control. Risks associated with information created by \ngenerative AI must be subject to the objective and professional control of \nfinancial institution personnel. \nBy stressing the principle of \"emphasizing fairness and human-centered \nvalues,\" the FSC urges financial institutions to pay attention to the values \nof diversity and inclusion when first designing AI systems, provide fair and \ninclusive financial services during the use of AI systems, and conform to \nsocial values and public expectations consistently throughout the entire \nprocess. \n4.3 Core Principle 3: Protecting privacy and customer interests \n(corresponding to the supervisory principle of \"protecting financial \nconsumers\") \n(1)Financial institutions should fully respect and protect the interests of \nconsumers, and manage and use customer data properly. \n(2)Financial institutions applying AI systems to provide financial \nservices should respect the customer's right to choose, and should \nremind the customer of available alternatives. \nDescription: \n\"Protecting privacy and customer interests\" is another important element \nfinancial institutions must consider when applying AI systems. With the \ndevelopment of big data and AI technology, the personal data of customers \nare often massively collected and used for the training of AI to increase its \naccuracy. But this practice may impact the privacy of customers, negatively \naffect public trust toward financial institutions, and lessen the degree of \nservice satisfaction. \nWhen using customer data, financial institutions must fully respect and \nprotect customer privacy and properly manage and utilize related data to \navoid any risk of data leakage. For example, in the absence of a proper \ncontrol mechanism (an example of a proper control mechanism is a \ngenerative AI model deployed in a closed, on-premises environment in a \nway that ensures the security of the system environment), a financial \ninstitution should not input data without customer consent for disclosure \ninto generative AI. Financial institutions should also respect the right of \ncustomers to choose AI services or not, and remind customers whether \nthere are alternatives available. This is a way to protect customers' right to \nchoose, and is also a way to safeguard customer interests. \nBy implementing the principle of \"protecting privacy and customer \ninterests,\" financial institutions are able to meet regulatory requirements, \n14 \n \nenhance consumer confidence and satisfaction, and promote sound \nbusiness development. \n4.4 Core Principle 4: Ensuring system robustness and security \n(corresponding to the supervisory principle of \"enhancing \ninformation security\") \n(1)When applying AI systems, financial institutions must ensure system \nrobustness, security, and safety to avoid causing harm to consumers \nor the financial system. \n(2)Financial institutions that outsource the development or operation of \nAI systems for financial services should conduct appropriate risk \nmanagement and oversight of the third-party providers. \nDescription: \nDigital technology is evolving rapidly, and AI has become an important \ntool for the financial industry to promote innovation and improve service \nquality. However, risks associated with the spread and use of AI are real. \nIn particular, due to the special nature of the financial services sector, any \nsystem error or data leak could cause immense harm to consumers or even \nthe entire financial system. Those risks could arise from technological \nmalfunctions, malicious attacks, or wrong decisions made by an AI system. \nTherefore, it is of utmost importance for financial institutions to \"ensure \nsystem robustness, security, and safety\" in the process of applying AI \nsystems. A financial institution must have adequate ability to develop and \nmaintain secure AI systems, and the ability to conduct ongoing monitoring \nof the operational results of AI systems, and take appropriate control \nmeasures where necessary. \nTo successfully \"ensure system robustness, security and safety,\" risk \nmanagement and oversight are indispensable when a financial institution \nprovides financial services applying AI systems developed or operated by \nthird-party service providers. Prior to engaging the service of such a third-\nparty service provider, a financial institution must perform due diligence \nto determine whether the service provider possesses related knowledge, \nexpertise, and experience, and must fully understand and evaluate the \noperating modes of its AI system and potential risks (including the \nhandling of data privacy, operating risks, information security, and \nconcentration risk), and based on the evaluation results, must implement a \nproper oversight strategy and management practices to prevent possible \nrisks or problems. The financial institution should also clearly define the \nresponsibilities of the service provider and plan ahead-of-time solutions for \nproblems that may arise in case of adverse events. In addition, financial \n15 \n \ninstitutions should have AI related algorithmic rules and save the trails and \nrecords to facilitate subsequent verification and management. \nBased on the principle of \"ensuring system robustness, security and \nsafety,\" the FSC hopes that while maintaining financial stability and \nprotecting consumer interests, financial institutions are able to use AI \nsystems in an innovative manner, with confidence and robustness, so as to \nprovide consumers with better financial services. \n4.5 Core Principle 5: Ensuring transparency and explainability \n(corresponding to the supervisory principle of \"information \ndisclosure\") \n(1)Financial institutions should ensure the transparency and \nexplainability of their operations. \n(2)Financial institutions should make proper disclosure when their AI \nsystem interacts directly with consumers\n17. \nDescription: \nIn the field of artificial intelligence, the importance of \"ensuring \ntransparency and explainability\" is widely acknowledged. It denotes that \nhow an AI system works should be comprehensible and explainable. This \nprinciple is all the more imperative when applying AI in financial services. \nFor financial institutions, explainable AI systems enable them to \neffectively assess and manage the risks of implementing AI and determine \nthe effectiveness of AI systems. Financial institutions must understand how \nAI makes decisions so as to detect potential problems and make necessary \nadjustments to ensure effective management of AI operations. \nFor stakeholders, the principle of \"ensuring transparency and \nexplainability\" implies that financial institutions should evaluate how to \nmake proper disclosure to stakeholders. For instance, a financial institution \nshould make proper disclosure when using AI to interact directly with \nconsumers; as for AI systems relating to money laundering prevention, \ninformation security, or fraud prevention, or involving trade secrets, risk \nmay arise from over-disclosure of information. In such event, a financial \ninstitution should be cautious about the contents of disclosure or opt not to \ndisclose. Financial institutions should also make sure the degree of \nexplainability matches the importance of an AI system. In particular, \nhumans who are adversely affected by an AI system should be able to \nunderstand or challenge the results of the AI system based on plain and \n \n17 In reference to Point 6 of the draft of \"Reference Guidelines for the Use of Generative AI by \nExecutive Yuan and Subordinate Agencies (Institutions).\" \n16 \n \neasy-to-understand information on the factors, and the logic that serves as \nthe basis for predictions, recommendations, or decisions. \n4.6 Core Principle 6: Promoting sustainable development \n(corresponding to the supervisory principle of \" Sustainable \nfinance and employee care\") \n(1)Financial institutions should, when applying AI systems, ensure that \ntheir \nAI \ndevelopment \nstrategies \nand \nimplementation \nare \ncommensurate with the principle of sustainable development, \nincluding reducing economic and social inequality, and protecting the \nnatural environment, thereby promoting inclusive growth, sustainable \ndevelopment, and social well-being. \n(2)Financial institutions should, in the process of applying AI systems, \nprovide employees with proper education and training that could help \nthem adapt to changes brought about by AI, and make efforts to \nprotect employees' work rights. \nDescription: \nThe purpose of formulating the principle of \"promoting sustainable \ndevelopment\" is to remind financial institutions that AI is used not only to \nimprove efficiency and profitability, but also to promote the inclusive \ngrowth and sustainable development of the entire society. \nFinancial institutions should ensure that their AI strategy and \nimplementation methodology match the principle of sustainable \ndevelopment. This means that, while offering innovative financial services, \na financial institution should also take into consideration how to increase \nthe financial participation of disadvantaged groups, how to reduce \neconomic, social, gender, and age inequalities, and how to promote \nenvironmental protection through financial technology. In the aspect of \nsustainable development, financial institutions should be aware that \nmassive amounts of energy used by AI systems could produce a negative \nimpact on the environment and ecosystems. \nIn addition, financial institutions must respect and protect the work \nrights of regular employees, including by providing proper education and \ntraining to employees during the course of AI transformation to help them \nadapt to the new working environment. This helps safeguard employees' \nwork rights and cultivates professionals with the skills to operate an AI \nsystem that will enhance the institution's competitive edge. \nOverall, this principle emphasizes that while using AI to pursue \neconomic benefits, a financial institution should give equal emphasis to the \n17 \n \nideals of sustainability, caring for the disadvantaged, reducing inequality, \nand protecting worker rights to promote the well-being and progress of the \nsociety as a whole. \n5. FSC's supporting policies for promoting AI development \n(1)On the basis of the aforementioned principles, the FSC will publish \nthe \"Guidelines for AI Applications in the Financial Industry\". Taking \ninto account factors such as the extent to which financial institutions \nuse AI systems, institutions' reliance on data, AI functions, \nautonomous behaviors, and whether AI systems are customer-facing \nor non-customer-facing, the guidelines will set out matters to comply \nwith based on the principle of proportionality, using a risk-based \napproach. The guidelines will seek to bring about the sound \ndevelopment of the financial sector , maintain financial stability, and \nsafeguard consumer interests. \n(2)Continue to examine relevant FSC regulation and make regulatory \nadjustments in a timely manner to build a sound regulatory \nenvironment for the use of AI systems in the financial sector. \n(3)Use AI technology to develop SupTech to enhance the efficiency and \neffectiveness of financial supervision. \n(4)Engage in exchanges and collaborations with international \norganizations and foreign financial supervisory agencies to ensure \nthat our supervisory policies are consistent with mainstream \ninternational trends. \n(5)Continue to encourage financial institutions to actively participate in \nAI research, development and application to provide customers with \nbetter financial services or develop RegTech. The FSC will also hold \nseminars and workshops to assist financial institutions in \nimplementing best practices. \n(6)Continue to grasp and inspect the actual status of AI use in the \nfinancial sector, and where necessary, conduct special financial \nexaminations to make sure financial institutions comply with \napplicable regulations and practice risk management in the use of AI \nsystems, and use AI to increase public trust and social well-being. \n(7)Instruct financial industry associations to draft self-regulatory \nstandards and best practices regarding the use of AI systems by \nfinancial institutions to enhance their information security, internal \ncontrol, and fair customer treatment, and make sure financial \ninstitutions continue to assist their employees in AI transformation \n18 \n \nand pay attention to worker rights in the course of AI implementation. \n(8)Continue to oversee financial institutions' compliance with fair \ncustomer treatment and friendly financial guidelines, and conduct \nfinancial literacy programs to enhance public awareness of the use of \ndigital financial tools, thereby reducing the digital divide and \nensuring the fair transformation of digital finance. \n6. Conclusion \nAs AI advances rapidly and its applications continue to expand, \ntrustworthy AI will play an increasingly important role in the field of \nfinance. AI offers wide-ranging potential, in matters ranging from \nimproving the efficiency of financial services to deepening customer \nrelations. However, to make the most of this new technology, one must \nseek a balance between innovation and responsibility in the use of AI \nsystems. One must ensure fairness and transparency, and be fully prepared \nfor possible risks and challenges. \nThe introduction of principles and policies for the use of AI in the \nfinancial sector aims to guide financial institutions to create value when \napplying AI systems, and moreover, to protect consumer interests, maintain \nfinancial stability, and realize inclusive sustainability. The FSC hopes that \nthrough the implementation of related principles and policies, financial \ninstitutions can maximize their functions and bring greater benefits to \ncustomers and society in the upcoming era of AI. \n \n19 \n \nAttachment: Six Core Principles for AI applications in the Financial \nSector \n1.Establishing governance and accountability mechanisms \n(1)Financial \ninstitutions \nshould \nbear \ninternal \nand \nexternal \nresponsibilities corresponding to the AI systems they use. Internal \nresponsibilities include assigning a senior executive to be responsible \nfor related oversight and management, and establishing an internal \ngovernance \nframework; \nexternal \nresponsibilities \ninvolve \nresponsibilities to consumers and the society, including protecting \nconsumer privacy and data security. \n(2)Financial institutions should establish a comprehensive and effective \nAI risk management mechanism, integrate it into prevailing risk \nmanagement and internal control operations or processes, and \nconduct periodic evaluation and testing. \n(3)Financial institutions should ensure that their employees have \nadequate knowledge and skills to work with AI, and carry out risk-\nbased decision making and supervision. \n2.Emphasizing fairness and human-centered values \n(1)Financial institutions should, in the process of utilizing AI systems, \ntry their best to avoid unfairness resulting from algorithmic bias. \n(2)The application of AI systems should be human-centric and \ncontrollable by humans, and should respect the rule of law and \ndemocratic values. \n(3)Risks associated with information produced by generative AI must be \nobjectively and professionally controlled by financial institution \npersonnel. \n3.Protecting privacy and customer interests \n(1)Financial institutions should fully respect and protect the interests of \nconsumers, and manage and use customer data properly. \n(2)Financial institutions applying AI systems to provide financial \nservices should respect the customer's right to choose, and should \nremind the customer of available alternatives. \n4.Ensuring system robustness and security \n(1)When applying AI systems, financial institutions must ensure system \nrobustness, security, and safety to avoid causing harm to consumers \nor the financial system. \n20 \n \n(2)Financial institutions that outsource the development or operation of \nAI systems for financial services should conduct appropriate risk \nmanagement and oversight of the third-party providers. \n5.Ensuring transparency and explainability \n(1)Financial institutions should ensure the transparency and \nexplainability of their operations. \n(2)Financial institutions should make proper disclosure when their AI \nsystem interacts directly with consumers. \n6.Promoting sustainable development \n(1)Financial institutions should, when applying AI systems, ensure that \ntheir \nAI \ndevelopment \nstrategies \nand \nimplementation \nare \ncommensurate with the principle of sustainable development, \nincluding reducing economic and social inequality, and protecting \nnatural environment, thereby promoting inclusive growth, sustainable \ndevelopment and social well-being. \n(2)Financial institutions should, in the process of applying AI systems, \nprovide employees with proper education and training that could help \nthem adapt to changes brought about by AI, and make efforts to \nprotect employees' work rights. \n \n", "metadata": {"country": "Taiwan", "year": "2023", "legally_binding": "no", "binding_proof": "This is a non-binding policy framework issued by Taiwan\u2019s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) to guide responsible development and use of AI in the financial sector.", "date": "10/17/2023", "regulator": "Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), Taiwan", "type": "sectoral AI policy", "status": "pending", "language": "English", "use_cases": "[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]"}}

These \nGuidelines are established in accordance with the \"Core Principles and \nPolicies for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Applications in the Financial \nIndustry\" to help the financial sector identify and pay attention to key \npoints of concern in the life cycle of AI systems. The Guidelines also \nreferenced regulations or manuals of the Bank for International Settlements \n(BIS), International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), \nEuropean Union, Singapore, and the United States to provide the financial \nsector with guidelines for the application of AI. \nThese Guidelines include the General Provisions and six main \nchapters. The General Provisions explain common issues such as AI-\nrelated definitions, the AI life cycle, risk assessment factors, risk-based \nimplementation of core principles, and supervision and management of \nthird-party operators. Chapters 1 to 6 describe the key concerns and \nmeasures that the financial industry can take when implementing AI Core \nPrinciples 1 to 6 based on the AI life cycle and the assessed risks. \nThese guidelines are administrative and non-binding in nature and are \nformulated to encourage the financial industry to introduce, use, and \nmanage AI while controlling risks. The examples cited in this document \nare provided for reference and financial institutions are encouraged to \nadopt them based on their respective conditions. Due to the high degree of \ncorrelation between the core principles, the financial industry is advised to \ninteractively assess the feasibility of each key point or measure when \nintroducing and using AI systems when referencing these Guidelines. They \nshould avoid focusing on a single core principle and failing to \ncomprehensively control risks. In addition, there are many ways to achieve \nthe goal of \"adequate AI risk management.\" These Guidelines implement \nthe core principles in a risk-based manner, while making reference to best \n2 \n \npractices in other countries and in Taiwan to provide internal rules 1 . \nDepending on the risks associated with the use of AI systems, financial \ninstitutions may choose risk mitigation mechanisms and implementation \nmethods in accordance with the core principles, including adopting more \ncost-effective methods to achieve the objectives. \nThe financial institutions specified in the chapters in these Guidelines \nrefer to financial holding companies, banks, credit cooperatives, bills \nfinance companies, credit card companies, trust enterprises, electronic \npayment institutions, post offices engaging in postal remittances or simple \nlife insurance business, securities firms, securities investment trust \nenterprises, securities finance enterprises, securities investment consulting \nenterprises, futures commission merchants, leverage transaction merchants, \nfutures trust enterprises, managed futures enterprise, futures consultant \ncompanies, insurance companies, insurance cooperatives, insurance agents, \ninsurance brokers, and insurance surveyors. If relevant financial industry \nassociations have set up self-regulatory guidelines on the application of AI, \nthey may reference these Guidelines and incorporate relevant key points \nand measures. If they have not set up relevant self-regulatory guidelines, \nfinancial institutions are advised to reference these Guidelines for the \nintroduction, use, and management of AI systems. When financial \ninstitutions apply AI systems for financial innovation businesses, the FSC \nencourages financial institutions to conduct tests through mechanisms such \nas FinTech Innovation Experimentation or financial business trials, if \ndeemed necessary. \n \n \n \n \n \n1 If branch offices of foreign groups in Taiwan are provided with AI applications by the group, they \nmay be processed in accordance with group regulations. \n3 \n \nGeneral Provisions  Common Issues \nI. Definitions of Artificial Intelligence (AI)2 \n(I) Definitions of AI systems: They refer to systems that simulate human \nlearning, thinking, and response patterns by learning vast amounts of \ndata and using machine learning or related modeling algorithms for \nperception, prediction, decision-making, planning, reasoning, and \ncommunication. \n(II) Definition of generative AI: Generative AI refers to AI systems that can \ngenerate content with simulated human intelligence and creativity in \nthe forms that include but are not limited to text, images, audio, video, \nand coding. \nII. AI System Life Cycle \nThe life cycle of an AI system consists of the four stages set forth below: \n(I) System planning and design: Set clear system objectives and \nrequirements. \n(II) Data collection and input: Data collection, processing, and input into \nthe database. \n(III) Model building and validation: Select and build model algorithms and \ntraining models, and validate the models to ensure model performance, \nsecurity, and confidentiality. \n(IV) System deployment and monitoring: Apply the system in real-world \nenvironments, verify the integrity of the model, and implement \ncontinuous monitoring to verify the potential impact of the system. \nAI systems applied by financial institutions may be self-developed3 for \nuse and therefore include the four stages described above. Financial \ninstitutions may also commission a third party to develop or purchase an \nAI system and then deploy the system and implement monitoring. \nTherefore, not all financial institutions will go through the four stages \ndescribed above. When applying AI systems, financial institutions are \nadvised to identify the extent to which they can monitor and control the \n \n2  The \"Operating Regulations for the Use of Artificial Intelligence Technologies by Financial \nInstitutions\" of the Bankers Association are used as the reference for the definitions of artificial \nintelligence. \n3 Self-developed systems include those that are developed entirely by financial institutions and AI \nsystems that are cooperatively or jointly developed with other financial institutions, as well as pre-\nexisting AI systems that are independently trained or fine-tuned using existing open-source AI models. \n4 \n \nrisks in the four stages, and to define the division of responsibilities for risk \nmonitoring and control with vendors through contracts or other means for \nparts or matters over which they have less control. For the purpose of \nsimplifying text, these Guidelines adopted \"introduce\" AI to represent \nstages (I), (II) and (III), and \"use\" AI to represent stage (IV). The concept \nof \"applying\" AI in these Guidelines is an overall framework that includes \nthe four stages described above. \nIII. Factors in Risk Assessment \nWhen financial institutions apply AI systems, they are advised to evaluate \nthe risks associated with individual usage scenarios. They are also advised \nto allocate more resources to high-risk AI systems to ensure effective risk \nmanagement. The factors to be considered in risk assessments are as \nfollows: (The following are examples that help illustrate the risk \nassessment scenarios and they are not intended to be used for regulating \nthe risk level of the relevant usage scenarios. The level of risk involved in \nusing AI systems must still be determined by the financial institutions after \nconsidering all factors in the risk assessment.) \n(I) Whether it is used to provide direct customer service or has a significant \nimpact on operations \n  1. AI systems that provide customer service (customer-facing): AI \nsystems with AI decision-making results that have a significant \nimpact on customers' rights and interests or operations usually incur \nhigher risks, and examples include those used in credit scoring and \nrobotic financial management systems. AI systems with AI decision-\nmaking results that only enhance the quality of customer service may \nincur lower risks, and examples include intelligent customer service \nsystems. \n  2. AI systems used for internal operations (not customer-facing): AI \nsystems with AI decision-making results that involve supervisory \nregulations usually incur higher risks, and examples include those \nused in legal capital adequacy assessment and money laundering \nprevention systems. AI systems with AI decision-making results that \ndo not involve supervisory regulations may incur lower risks, and \nexamples include systems used to improve the efficiency of internal \nadministrative operations. \n(II) Extent of use of personal data: A higher extent of the use of raw \npersonal data4 or sensitive personal information in an AI system may \n \n4 Raw personal data refers to personal data that has not been de-identified, processed by privacy-\nenhancing technologies, or processed through other means. \n5 \n \nincur higher risks. \n(III) Extent of AI autonomy: AI systems that replace human decision-\nmaking to a higher extent or have a higher extent of automated \nlearning may have a higher risk of an increase in unanticipated \nnegative systemic impacts or decreased chance of immediate human \nintervention. \n(IV) Complexity of the AI system: AI systems with a more complex \ncomputational model or a higher number and type of parameters used \nmay reduce explainability and incur higher risks. \n(V) Extent and reach of impact on different stakeholders: AI system \ndecision-making results may incur higher risks if they have a more \nprofound impact on internal and external stakeholders, or if they affect \nmore categories and a higher number of stakeholders. \n(VI) Integrity of relief5 options: AI system decision-making results that do \nnot provide stakeholder relief options or provide incomplete relief \noptions may incur higher risks. \nIV. Risk-Based Implementation of Core Principles \nFinancial institutions are advised to determine the risk control measures to \nbe adopted and the extent of such measures based on the results of the risk \nassessment of AI systems, and ensure that they are in line with their current \npractices. For AI systems with higher risks, in addition to paying attention \nto the key points and measures listed in Chapters 1 to 6 during the \nintroduction and use of the system, financial institutions must also evaluate \nwhether to adopt the following measures: \n(I) Records: The application of high-risk systems should require more \ncomprehensive written or digital records. \n(II) Monitoring and control mechanisms: The application of high-risk \nsystems should require the establishment of a higher frequency of \nmonitoring and control and a wider range of monitoring and control \nmechanisms. \n(III) Review and approval: The application of high-risk systems should \nrequire a more stringent review and approval process and an elevated \ndecision-making level. \n(IV) Audit or evaluation mechanism: After evaluating AI system risks, \ninternal resources, and requirements for professional services, a third-\n \n5 Remedies may include channels for complaints or remedies and dispute resolution mechanisms. \n6 \n \nparty audit or evaluation unit may conduct independent verification if \nnecessary. If the introduced AI system is developed or managed by \nthe same group (including its affiliates), relevant audits may be \nreplaced by information provided by the group. \nV. Supervision and Management of Third-Party Operators \nWhen financial institutions commission a third-party operator to introduce \nAI system-related operations, it is advisable to take the following \nsupervisory and management measures: \n(I) Financial institutions should first conduct a review to assess whether \nthe third-party operator has the relevant knowledge, expertise, and \nexperience, and determine the concentration risk associated with the \ncommission of the third-party operator (the concentration risk of the \nfinancial institution's own commission of the third-party operator). \nThey must then adopt appropriate supervisory strategies and \nmanagement actions based on the results of the review to prevent any \npossible risks or issues. \n(II) Financial institutions are advised to sign written contracts with third-\nparty operators to specify the scope of the introduction, the third-party \noperator's scope of responsibilities, and recourse for its failure to meet \nperformance targets or the occurrence of adverse events. \n(III) When a financial institution commissions a third-party operator to \nintroduce relevant operations, if it involves the transmission of \ncustomer data to a third-party operator for processing, it is advisable \nto sign an agreement with the third-party operator containing the \nterms for data protection, which clearly require encrypted data \ntransmission, secure storage, and data disposal upon termination of \nservices. \n(IV) When financial institutions commission a third-party operator to \nintroduce an AI system, or when financial institutions conduct testing \nand monitoring operations, they must pay attention to the third-party \noperator's outsourcing agreements and they should clarify the division \nof responsibilities. They must also establish an appropriate data or \nsystem migration mechanism in case of the termination of the \noutsourced operation. \n(V) Financial institutions shall require third-party operators to keep written \nor digital operation records of the execution of the commissioned tasks \nto facilitate subsequent tracking, verification, and management. \n(VI) If a third-party provider is commissioned by a financial institution to \n7 \n \ncarry out affairs involving the outsourcing of financial industry \noperations, it should comply with the relevant outsourcing regulations \nof each industry. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nChapter 1 Establishing Governance and \nAccountability Mechanisms \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n*This core principle is based on the \"Core Principles and Policies for Artificial \nIntelligence (AI) Applications in the Financial Industry\" published by the FSC on \nOctober 17, 2023. \nI. Purpose \nFinancial institutions may apply multiple AI systems. Therefore, the \nGuidelines advise financial institutions to set up a clear framework and \nrisk management policy for managing AI systems, understand the \npurpose of the AI system, the applicable business or operation, and the \nresponsible personnel, and ensure that they are able to explain the \nsystem's logic internally, explain the overall policy externally, and \nexplain matters that consumers need to know about individual AI \nsystems. They must also set comprehensive procedures for dealing with \nerrors or unanticipated events. Financial institutions are also advised to \ncontinue to enhance their employees' understanding of and ability to \nintroduce, use, and manage AI systems in order to adapt to the rapid \ndevelopment and changes in AI technologies. \nII. Main Concepts \n(I) Internal and external responsibilities of financial institutions for the \napplication of AI systems \nCore Principle 1: Establishing governance and accountability \nmechanisms \n(I) Financial institutions should bear internal and external \nresponsibilities corresponding to the AI systems they use. Internal \nresponsibilities include assigning a senior executive to be \nresponsible for related oversight and management, and \nestablishing an internal governance framework; external \nresponsibilities involve responsibilities to consumers and the \nsociety, including protecting consumer privacy and data security. \n(II) Financial institutions should establish a comprehensive and \neffective AI risk management mechanism, integrate it into \nprevailing risk management and internal control operations or \nprocesses, and conduct periodic evaluation and testing. \n(III) Financial institutions should ensure that their employees have \nadequate knowledge and skills to work with AI, and carry out risk-\nbased decision making and supervision. \n9 \n \n 1. Internal responsibility refers to the definitions of the authority and \nresponsibility of each unit within the organization, including a clear \ninternal governance framework, supervision and management by \nsenior executives or designated committees that can oversee cross-\ndepartmental duties, definitions of the functions and responsibilities \nof each department or line of business, and implementation of \nhierarchical management mechanisms. \n  2. External responsibility refers to the ability of the organization to \ncommunicate externally about the organization's actions, including \nchannels or communication mechanisms that allow external parties \nto inquire about or review relevant information on matters affected \nby decisions, and to ensure that the use of the AI system is consistent \nwith the planned objectives. \n(II) When implementing the principles of governance and accountability, \nfinancial institutions are advised to document or digitize relevant \nmechanisms and operations and establish appropriate oversight \nmechanisms to the best of their abilities. \n(III) Financial institutions should implement all core principles of AI for \nthe financial industry and should not treat any of the principles as a \none-time or independent task. \nIII. Organizational Structure and Accountability \nMechanisms \n(I) Organizational structure and roles and responsibilities for AI systems: \nFinancial institutions are advised to establish an organizational \nstructure for the application of AI systems in their organization, \nincluding whether to designate a department or team responsible for the \nentire AI system. Each department or team as well as business lines that \napply the AI system and units assigned for operations and activities in \neach phase of the AI life cycle are advised to clearly define their \nresponsibilities as well the roles, functions, and responsibilities of their \npersonnel. \n(II) Designate senior executives or committees for supervision and \ncoordination: Financial institutions may designate a senior executive \nor committee capable of overseeing inter-departmental businesses and \ntake charge of the overall supervision and management of the use of \nAI systems. The senior executive or committee and the departments \nor teams they lead should formulate AI policies and take charge of \nsupervising the use of AI systems. If a financial institution introduces \nan AI system on its own, it should supervise the planning and design \nof the system, data collection and input, and modeling and validation \n10 \n \nof the AI system throughout its life cycle, and ensure compliance with \nlaws and regulations in the process of application. \nIV. Risk Management Mechanisms \n(I) Set clear risk management policies or risk-based integration into \nexisting mechanisms \n1. Financial institutions may set clear risk management policies and \nguidelines for the application of AI systems that include items such \nas risk management, data collection, security control, compliance \nrequirements, monitoring, and assessment. Financial institutions are \nalso advised to create an organizational culture conducive to AI \ndevelopment, encourage the implementation of AI core principles and \nthe realization of responsible AI, and set mechanisms to allow \nemployees to raise questions or concerns if they express concern \nabout the AI system. \n2. Integrate AI risk management into the existing risk management and \ninternal control framework: Integrated items include model risk \nmanagement, information security, data protection, and measures for \ntreating customers fairly. If there are still deficiencies, additional risk \nmanagement and internal control frameworks may be added to \ncomply with the core principles of AI. \n(II) Risk management of AI models \n  1. Pre-deployment management: Financial institutions are advised to \nunderstand and document the purpose and intended use of the AI \nmodel as well as the methodology and concepts used in the AI model. \nFinancial institutions are advised test the model before deployment \nto ensure that the results meet the objectives. \n2. Continuous validation: Financial institutions are advised to conduct \ncontinuous validation of the AI model wherever possible. However, \nthe frequency of validation may vary based on the complexity of the \nmodel and the performance of the tools used for periodic reviews. \nFinancial institutions may evaluate the reliability, ability to facilitate \nrecognition, and error correction of the model, and check for any sign \nof deterioration in the quality of the results produced by the model. \n3. Create model inventory: Financial institutions are advised to create \nand maintain an inventory of AI models that includes information on \npast and current versions of each AI model and those under \ndevelopment6. The inventory should include the type and source of \ndata input, the output and intended use of the model, and an \nassessment of whether the model is operating as intended. \n \n6 Information on versions of models in the development process shall be retained for a period of time \ndetermined by the financial institution based on the importance of the model. \n11 \n \n(III) Continuous monitoring and improvements: Financial institutions are \nadvised to maintain, monitor, document, and review deployed AI \nsystems and provide appropriate resources based on factors in risk \nassessment, and help the management understand the performance of \ndeployed AI systems and other relevant matters. Under suitable \nconditions, the monitoring may include autonomous monitoring with \nAI systems designed to automatically report on the level of confidence \nin their predictions. \n(IV) Regular review of risk management mechanisms to increase \neffectiveness \n1. Establish internal review and monitoring mechanisms: Financial \ninstitutions are advised to establish risk-based internal review and \nmonitoring mechanisms to regularly assess whether AI systems meet \nthe original objectives of application and the level of risks to ensure \nthat AI systems are in line with policies and guidelines and to resolve \nany potential problems in a timely manner. Financial institutions may, \nwhere necessary, invite specialists from different fields to participate \nin the AI evaluation process. They may include specialists in human \nresources, behavioral science, law, ethics, and sustainable \ndevelopment who can help provide insights for AI development. \n2. Establishment of independent third-party review and communication \nmechanisms: After evaluating the risk, internal resources, and \nrequirements for professional services of AI systems with higher risks, \nfinancial institutions may, if necessary, establish mechanisms for an \nindependent third-party with AI expertise to carry out the review and \nassessment. They may also set up channels or communication \nmechanisms to allow external parties to inquire or review the relevant \ninformation on the matters that are affected by the decision-making \nprocess to facilitate feedback from external parties and help financial \ninstitutions comply with the core principles in their application of AI \nsystems. \nV. Personnel Training \n(I) Financial institutions are advised to provide training and resources for \nthe departments, teams, and relevant personnel responsible for AI \nsystems to enhance personnel\u2019s understanding of and ability to \nintroduce, use, and manage AI systems, adapt to the rapid development \nand changes in AI technologies, and implement suitable risk-based \ndecision-making and supervision. These personnel include senior \nmanagement responsible for the overall AI system, project managers \n(e.g. development, testing, supervision, compliance, risk control, and \ninternal audit personnel), supervisors, execution teams, and other \nrelevant employees. Financial institutions are also advised to verify that \n12 \n \ntheir board of directors and management have knowledge of the AI \nsystem they use. \n(II) Financial institutions are advised to identify new and changing roles, \nassess the skills that must be upgraded or reacquired, and the \ncharacteristics of new employees that they need to recruit to help the \norganization adapt to new ways of working and achieve effective \nhuman-machine collaboration. \n(III) Financial institutions are also advised to establish communication and \ninteraction channels with stakeholders, so that AI system appliers can \neasily incorporate feedback from all sectors into each stage of the life \ncycle. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \nChapter 2 Emphasizing Fairness and Human-\nCentered Values \n \n \n \n \n \n \n*This core principle is based on the \"Core Principles and Policies for Artificial \nIntelligence (AI) Applications in the Financial Industry\" published by the FSC on \nOctober 17, 2023. \nI. Purpose \nDue to the automated nature of AI systems, if operators fail to pay close \nattention to the design, data collection, and modeling, it may result in \ndiscrimination or unfairness, or conditions beyond human control. \nTherefore, when financial institutions apply AI systems, they are \nadvised to assess their fairness, enhance the reasonableness and \naccuracy of their decisions, pay attention to the biases, and avoid \ndiscrimination wherever possible. When collecting data, it is advisable \nto pay attention to its source and possible biases, use personal data with \ncare, and regularly review and validate the results of AI models to \nenhance the accuracy of the AI system and achieve its purpose and to \navoid discrimination wherever possible. In addition, AI systems should \nbe applied in a manner that supports human autonomy, respect \nfundamental human rights, and permits human oversight. \nII. Main Concepts \n(I) Fairness: The decisions produced by AI systems applied by financial \ninstitutions must not result in discriminatory outcomes for specific \ngroups. It means that decisions must be reasonable, accurate, and as \nnon-discriminatory as possible. \n1. Reasonableness of decisions: (1) If personal attributes are utilized as \nfactors in the decision-making of the AI model, there must be \nreasonable justification; (2) If there is no reasonable justification, the \nCore Principle 2: Emphasizing fairness and human-centered values \n(I) Financial institutions should, in the process of using AI systems, try \ntheir best to avoid unfairness resulting from algorithmic bias. \n(II) The application of AI systems should be human-centric and \ncontrollable by humans, and should respect the rule of law and \ndemocratic values. \n(III) Risks associated with information produced by generative AI must \nbe objectively and professionally controlled by financial institution \npersonnel. \n14 \n \ndecision made by the AI system must not be systematically \nunfavorable to a particular group of people (e.g. no unreasonable loan \nconditions based on the borrower's religion, race, gender, disability, \nsexual orientation, place of residence, political affiliation, age, \nnationality, or ethnicity). \n2. Accuracy of decisions and avoidance of discrimination where possible: \nAI decision-making models and data should be regularly reviewed and \nvalidated to increase their accuracy and avoid discrimination as much \nas possible. Financial institutions are also advised to regularly review \nthe resulting decisions generated by the models to ensure that the \nresults of the model calculations are in line with the purpose of the \ndesign. \n(II) Human-centered: The AI system should be designed to support human \nautonomy, respect basic human rights, and allow human oversight \nthroughout its life cycle in order to realize human values and achieve \nthe goal of improving human well-being. \n(III) For consumers who are affected by adverse outcomes, financial \ninstitutions are encouraged to provide remedies, which may include \nexisting remedies already provided by the financial institutions. \nHowever, if the AI system applied by a financial institution for money \nlaundering prevention or fraud detection and the supply of remedial \noptions is not suitable, it may be withheld. \n(IV) The supervision mechanisms of humans in AI systems' decision-\nmaking process employ human-in-command (HIC), human-in-the-\nloop (HITL), and human-over-the-loop (HOTL) approaches, which \nare described as follows: \n1. \"Human-in-command\": It refers to the ability of humans to command \nand supervise the overall activities of an AI system (including its \nbroader economic, social, legal, and ethical impacts), and to decide \nwhen and how to use the AI system under any condition. \n2. \"Human-in-the-loop\": It means that humans actively participate in the \nsupervision and retain full control, and the AI system only provides \nsuggestions or information. The AI system cannot make decisions \nunless the human issues a command to the AI system to do so. \n3. \"Human-over-the-loop\": Humans only take over control and adjust \nparameters during the computing process when the AI model \nencounters accidents or undesirable events (e.g. model failure). \n \n15 \n \nIII. Implementation of Fairness \nFinancial institutions are advised to pay attention to the following issues at \neach phase of the AI system life cycle, assess the fairness risk rating, and \ntake appropriate risk-based measures: \n(I) \"System planning and design\" phase \n1. Establish the purpose and identify groups that may be adversely \naffected: Financial institutions are advised to verify the purpose of \nthe planned AI system and identify groups that may be subject to \ndisadvantageous treatment in the application of the AI system \n(hereinafter referred to as \"adversely affected groups\") and the \nlikelihood of adverse impact, and retain written or digital records. \n2. Inclusion of professionals: Financial institutions may, where \nnecessary, invite professionals to participate in the design and \nimplementation of the AI system. With their professional advice and \nguidance, financial institutions ensure that the design and \nimplementation of the AI system do not discriminate against any \nindividual or group. \n3. Provide remedial options: Financial institutions are advised to include \nor provide remedial options in the AI system for feedback from \nadversely affected groups, and collect opinions or suggestions from \nsuch groups for reference by financial institutions when they carry out \nsubsequent calibrations. \n(II) \"Data collection and input\" phase \n1. Financial institutions are advised to review the data they plan to \ncollect, the method of collection, and the source of the data for \npossible bias, and verify whether such bias is unfair or discriminatory. \n2. Financial institutions are encouraged to use data from diverse sources \nthat represent a range of backgrounds and characteristics instead of \nrelying solely on data from a single category or group to minimize \nbias and discrimination against certain groups. \n3. Financial institutions should exercise caution when using personal \nattributes (e.g. age, gender, place of residence, ethnic group, religion, \nand nationality). \n(1) Before deciding to collect or use personal attributes, it is advisable \nto determine whether the use of such attributes is consistent with \nthe planned purpose of AI system. \n16 \n \n(2) If the adoption of certain personal attributes may adversely affect \ncertain groups, it is advisable to evaluate the necessity of using \nsuch attributes and the possibility of using alternative attributes or \nalternative methods. Financial institutions should also keep the \nevaluation results, the methods employed, and the reasons in \nwritten or digital format. \n(III) \"Modeling and validation\" phase \n1. Self-examination of the results of models on different groups: If a \nfinancial institution independently develops an AI system or \ncommissions a third party to do so, it can test and validate the AI \nmodel's predictions and decisions on different groups to verify that its \noperations are fair and unbiased. If bias is found, the financial \ninstitution should assess and take appropriate adjustments and \nimprovements to avoid unfairness or discrimination as much as \npossible. \n2. Submission of results to independent and qualified external \nprofessionals for review and validation: If necessary, the financial \ninstitution may submit the results of the AI system to independent \nand qualified external professionals for review and validation to \nconfirm that decisions made by the AI system are as reasonable, \naccurate, and non-discriminatory as possible, and make any \nnecessary corrections or improvements. Financial institutions are \nalso advised to conduct due diligence to prevent possible conflicts \nof interest. \n3. Retention of written or digital records: To verify the fairness of the AI \nmodel, financial institutions are advised to retain easy-to-understand \nwritten or digital records of the purpose of the AI model design, \ncomputing logic, and the decision-making process. This ensures that \nstakeholders can understand the operating principles of the model and \nthe decision-making method, helps determine the fairness of the AI \nsystem for different groups, and facilitates tracing and interpretation \nof the relevant results. \n(IV) \"System deployment and monitoring\" phase \n1. Financial institutions are advised to regularly review and analyze the \nresults produced by the AI system for discrimination, and use the \ninformation collected through the remedial options to determine \nwhether there is unequal treatment of different groups by the AI model. \nIf an issue involving discrimination is found, the financial institution \nshould swiftly implement adjustments for improvement. \n17 \n \n2. Financial institutions are advised to identify any correlation between \nthe application of the AI system and a particular group of individuals \nwho are subject to adverse systemic treatment. If any is found, financial \ninstitutions are advised to adopt measures that reduce the impact on \nthat particular group of individuals. \nIV. Implementation of the Principles of Human-Centered and \nHuman-Controlled AI \n(I) Before a financial institution applies an AI system, it is advised to \ndetermine whether the system complies with laws and regulations and \ndetermine whether it would affect the autonomy or basic human rights \nof its customers. If it has not done so, it is advised to discontinue the \napplication of the AI system and implement improvement measures \nuntil such concerns are eliminated. \n(II) With respect to the scope of application of AI systems, when assessing \nthe degree of human participation required for the use of AI-assisted \ndecision-making, a financial institution is advised to consider the \ndegree of impact that AI decisions may have on its customers or \nfinancial institutions, and adopt different levels of supervisory \nmechanisms or to plan other possible risk mitigation, transfer, or \navoidance measures. With regard to the aforementioned applications \nwith a higher degree of impact, it is advisable to adopt human-in-\ncommand or human-in-the-loop supervisory mechanisms. \n(III) For important critical systems, a financial institution is advised to \nretain personnel access so that it can review, approve, or make final \ndecisions on the AI system, including ensuring that its personnel can \nintervene to take over control, and that the AI system can provide \nsufficient information for personnel to make meaningful decisions; or \nin the event that personnel cannot control or intervene in the decision-\nmaking process, the AI system can be securely shut down by \npersonnel. \nV. Risk Management of Output Information from \nGenerative AI \n(I) When a financial institution introduces generative AI, it is advised to \nassess whether it is biased or discriminatory against specific groups, and \nto reduce possible unfairness according to the above points. \n(II) When a financial institution uses generative AI developed by a third \nparty and is unable to control the training process and ensure that its \ndata or the results of its calculations meet fairness requirements, risks \n18 \n \nassociated with information produced by generative AI must be \nobjectively and professionally controlled by its personnel to avoid \nunfairness to clients or financial consumers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n19 \n \nChapter 3 Protecting Privacy and Customer \nInterests \n \n \n \n \n \n \n*This core principle is based on the \"Core Principles and Policies for Artificial \nIntelligence (AI) Applications in the Financial Industry\" published by the FSC on \nOctober 17, 2023. \nI. Purpose \nTo ensure accuracy, AI systems may need to collect vast amounts of \ninformation from consumers or customers and collect and process \ninformation when interacting with customers. Financial institutions are \ntherefore advised pay attention to customer privacy protection \nthroughout the life cycle of the AI system, adequately process customer \ninformation, avoid risks of data leakage, and adopt the principle of data \nminimization 7  to avoid the excessive or unnecessary collection of \nsensitive information. Financial institutions are also advised to respect \nthe customer's right to choose whether to use AI services, and \ndetermine whether to provide alternatives based on the risks, feasibility, \nand costs of the alternatives for the customer and the institution. \nII. Main Concepts \n(I) Due to the development of big data and AI technology, customers' \npersonal information is often collected in large quantities and used to \ntrain AI, which may threaten customers' privacy and affect the public \ntrust in financial institutions and service satisfaction. Financial \ninstitutions are therefore advised to pay attention to the protection of \ncustomers' privacy and the proper collection and handling of \ncustomers' information to avoid the risk of data leakage in the \napplication of AI systems. \n(II) Financial institutions are advised to collect and process necessary \ncustomer information based on the principle of data minimization and \n \n7 The principle of data minimization means that the collection of personal data must be appropriate, \nrelevant, and within the scope necessary for the purpose of data processing. \nCore Principle 3: Protecting privacy and customer interests \n(I) Financial institutions should fully respect and protect the interests of \nconsumers, and manage and use customer data properly. \n(II) Financial institutions applying AI systems to provide financial \nservices should respect the customer's right to choose, and should \nremind customers of available alternatives. \n20 \n \navoid excessive or unnecessary collection of sensitive information. \n(III) When applying AI systems in services for customers, financial \ninstitutions are advised to inform customers and respect their right to \nchoose whether to use AI services and remind them of the availability \nof alternatives to protect customer rights and interests. \n(IV) When applying AI systems, financial institutions are advised to pay \nattention to customer privacy protection, including personal \ninformation, intellectual property rights, and trade secrets. \nIII. Privacy Protection and Data Governance \n(I) For the implementation of customer privacy protection and data \ngovernance, a financial institution is advised to pay attention to the \nfollowing issues at each phase of the AI system life cycle: \n1. \"System planning and design\" phase \n(1) A financial institution is advised to assess whether the design of \nthe AI system complies with the Personal Data Protection Act and \nother relevant regulations and its internal data governance policies. \n(2) A financial institution is advised to evaluate the information to be \ncollected and determine the feasibility of data acquisition channels \nbased on the intended use of the AI system, and follow the \nprinciple of data minimization for collection and processing. If the \ncollected public information satisfies the purpose of AI system \ndesign, the collection non-public information is not required. \n(3) A financial institution is advised to set up mechanisms to protect \npersonal information from unauthorized access, damage, loss, or \nleakage. It should also process matters in accordance with the \n\"Regulations for the Security Maintenance of Personal Data Files \nby Non-Governmental Agencies Supervised and Designated by the \nFinancial Supervisory Commission.\" Financial institutions can \ntake measures such as encrypting sensitive information, setting up \naccess \ncontrol \nmechanisms, \nconducting \nregular \nsecurity \nmonitoring and audits, and ensuring that employees receive \nappropriate confidentiality training. \n2. \"Data collection and input\" phase \n(1) A financial institution is advised to record the source of \ninformation collection and ensure that information is obtained \nthrough legal and reliable channels. \n21 \n \n(2) A financial institution is advised to verify the accuracy and \ncompleteness of the information and examine the information for \nerrors. \n(3) If the data collected by a financial institution contains personal \ndata, the financial institution should verify that it has obtained the \nconsent of the customer or is in compliance with relevant laws and \nregulations, and implement risk-based evaluation on the necessity \nof additional privacy protection for the data8. \n3. \"Modeling and validation\" phase \n(1) A financial institution is advised to ensure that the information used \nto train AI models and the information generated by AI systems do \nnot violate personal data protection laws and related regulations. \n(2) A financial institution is advised to ensure that partners and vendors \nalso comply with privacy and security standards. \n4. \"System deployment and monitoring\" phase \n(1) A financial institution is advised to regularly monitor AI systems, \npartners, and suppliers to ensure their continuous compliance with \nrelevant privacy and security standards after deployment, and \ncheck for irregularities that may adversely affect the protection of \nfinancial consumers' privacy or their rights and interests. \n(2) If there is any data leakage or violation of the Personal Data \nProtection Act in its AI system, a financial institution shall notify \nand handle the matter through the existing mechanisms and \nimplement necessary adjustments to its AI system. \n(II) A financial institution must pay attention to the risk of customer data \nleakage that may result from the application of its AI system. For \ninstance, in the application of generative AI by its employees, unless \nappropriate control mechanisms are implemented, generative AI \nshould not be provided with information that has not been provided \nwith the consent of the customer. Examples of appropriate control \nmechanisms include the use of closed-source generative AI models and \nverification of the security of the system environment. This \nrequirement does not apply if the information does not involve personal \ndata and cannot be directly or indirectly used to identify the behavior \nof specific individuals as customers. \n \n8 Examples include pseudonymization, anonymization, or the use of privacy-enhancing technologies \n(PETs). \n22 \n \nIV. Respect for Customers' Right to Choose and Alternatives \n(I) A financial institution applying an AI system to provide financial \nservices should pay attention to the following matters: \n1. Should inform financial consumers that the financial service is \nprovided by an AI system. \n2. Should provide information to help financial consumers understand \nhow the AI system functions and how AI-assisted decision-making \nmay affect them in their regular use of the system. \n3. Should remind financial consumers of the availability of alternatives  \nto the AI system so that they can choose whether to use the services \nprovided by the AI system. \n(II) A financial institution may review the following factors when deciding \nwhether to offer alternatives when a customer discontinues the use of \nservices provided by the AI system: \n1. The risks and degree of harm to the financial institution. \n2. The risks and degree of harm to the customer. \n3. The likelihood that the customer will resume use of the AI system \nafter choosing an alternative. \n4. Feasibility and cost of the alternatives. \n5. The complexity and efficiency of the simultaneous appliction of AI \nsystems and alternatives. \n6. Technical feasibility. \n(III) If a financial institution decides not to provide an alternative after \nconsidering the aforementioned factors, it should evaluate whether to \nprovide remedial measures to the customer. \n \n23 \n \nChapter 4 Ensuring System Robustness and \nSecurity \n \n \n \n \n \n*This core principle is based on the \"Core Principles and Policies for Artificial \nIntelligence (AI) Applications in the Financial Industry\" published by the FSC \non October 17, 2023. \nI. Purpose \nAs financial institutions increase the application of AI systems, system \nstability and security gain prominence in the normal operation of \nfinancial institutions. Financial institutions should therefore define the \npurpose of the system and conduct risk assessment. They should \nchoose a resilient AI model, focus on the quality of the data when \ncollecting data, conduct appropriate interaction verification and \nresistance testing of the model, and deploy the AI system in an \nappropriate environment. They should also set up security measures to \nensure protection against security threats and attacks, and implement \ncontinuous monitoring to ensure the overall security and stable \noperation of the AI system. \nII. Main Concepts \n(I) System robustness: This refers to the methods set up in the AI system \nfor preventing the occurrence of risks, which not only ensure reliable \nperformance of its intended purpose, but also minimize unintended or \nunforeseen adverse effects and prevent unacceptable adverse effects. \nSystem robustness includes the following concepts: \n1. Stability: A stable AI system means that the computer system \nadequately addresses errors in execution and erroneous inputs, and \nthat the system or its components function correctly even when \nsubjected to invalid inputs or stressful environmental conditions. \n2. Accuracy: An AI system with high accuracy means that the system \nhas the ability to make correct judgments to achieve its intended \nCore Principle 4: Ensuring system robustness and security \n(I) When applying AI systems, financial institutions must ensure system \nrobustness and security to avoid causing harm to consumers or the \nfinancial system. \n(II) Financial institutions that outsource the development or operation \nof AI systems for financial services should conduct appropriate risk \nmanagement and oversight of the third-party providers. \n24 \n \npurpose, such as correctly dividing information into appropriate \ncategories or making predictions, recommendations, or decisions \nbased on data and models that meet the intended purpose. Well \nplanned and developed AI systems can minimize and correct the \nunintended risks associated with inaccurate predictions. Even if an AI \nsystem occasionally makes inaccurate predictions, the error rate can \nbe determined in tests. \n3. Reproducibility: A reproducible AI system means that repeated tests \nof the AI system under the same conditions yield similar output. \n(II) System security: A secure AI system refers to a system with strong \ndefense against external security threats, attacks, or malicious misuse \nof information security, and complies with the requirements of the \nfinancial industry's information security regulations, and ensures that \nits system operates in accordance with its intended functions. \nIII. Implementation of System Robustness \nFinancial institutions are advised to pay attention to the following issues at \neach phase of the AI system life cycle: \n(I) \"System planning and design\" phase \n1. Financial institutions are advised to define the purpose of the AI \nsystem and, based on that purpose, determine the indicators to be used \nto measure system robustness and the thresholds (standards) for such \nindicators. \n2. A financial institution is advised to assess the risk of failure of its AI \nsystem to achieve its intended purpose and plan for possible risk \nreduction, transfer, or avoidance. \n(II) \"Data collection and input\" phase \n1. Data management: High-quality data is the basis for ensuring the \nstability, accuracy, and reproducibility of AI models. Financial \ninstitutions are therefore advised to process data appropriately based \non the quality of the data and the intended purpose of the AI system, \nsuch as replacing missing values, implement data coding, and data \nstandardization. \n2. Financial institutions can also use automation tools to ensure data \nquality. \n(III) \"Modeling and validation\" phase \n1. A financial institution is advised to choose a model with greater \n25 \n \nresilience9 and ensure that the model meets its objectives. \n2. If a financial institution develops its own AI system or commissions \na third party to do so, it can enhance the robustness and reliability of \nthe AI model with cross-validation and calibration. \n3. A financial institution can use resilience tests to assess the resilience \nof AI models in response to unanticipated inputs and make necessary \nadjustments. \n4. A financial institution is advised to conduct effectiveness tests to \nverify that the AI model meets the minimum system stability \nindicators in initial settings. \n5. For an AI system with higher risk or greater impact, a financial \ninstitution should consider whether to test it first and separate the \ntesting environment from the regular operation environment. A \nfinancial institution can also test the performance of an AI system \nunder stressful market conditions. \n(IV) \"System deployment and monitoring\" phase \n1. A financial institution is advised to deploy an AI system in an \nappropriate environment to minimize the impact of external factors \n(e.g. power stability and network bandwidth) on the performance of \nthe AI system. \n2. A financial institution is advised to establish appropriate monitoring \nmechanisms to regularly check whether the AI model exhibits \ndeviation in its effectiveness, and to immediately address any decline \nin the accuracy of the model or other problems. \nIV. Implementation of System Security \n(I) A financial institution is advised to comply with system security \nregulations, set up suitable information security or management \nmeasures, and ensure protection against security threats and attacks \nsuch as hackers and malicious software. It should also implement \ncontinuous monitoring to ensure the security of the AI system. \n(II) A financial institution is advised to take control measures to avoid risk \nof any leak of model parameters or data due to inappropriate operations \nor human negligence by third-party operators during model training. \n(III) A financial institution is advised to pay attention to the following \n \n9 Resilience refers to the ability of an AI model to appropriately process unanticipated data entries or \ndecline to make predictions when the confidence level is too low. \n26 \n \nissues at each phase of the AI system life cycle: \n1. \"System planning and design\" phase \n  (1) Enhance employee awareness of security threats and risks and \nassist employees in planning appropriate methods to mitigate risks. \n(2) Assess potential threats to the system. \n(3) When selecting AI models, it is advised to consider security in \naddition to functionality and performance. \n2.\"Data collection and input\" phase: Strengthen data security control and \nreduce the risks of data leakage. \n3. \"Modeling and validation\" phase \n  (1) Assess or periodically review the security of suppliers of AI \ntechnologies and require suppliers to comply with security \nstandards. \n(2) Identify, track, and protect AI-related assets (e.g. models, data, \nprompts, software, record files, and internal assessments). \n(3) Retain written or digital records of models, data, and prompts. \n4. \"System deployment and monitoring\" phase \n(1) Protect infrastructure with measures including adequate control \nover the use of APIs, models, and data, and proactively prevent \ncyberattacks that lead to the theft of models or damage to \nperformance. \n(2) Protect models and data with measures such as implementing \ninformation security practices or managing user interfaces. \n(3) Conduct appropriate and effective security assessments before the \ndeployment of AI models. \n(4) Monitor the output and performance of models and systems to \nobserve changes that may jeopardize security. \n(5) While taking care to satisfy the prerequisite condition of privacy \nand data protection, record and appropriately monitor the contents \nentered into the system. \n(6) Use secure and modularized processes for updates. \n \n \n \n27 \n \nChapter 5 Ensuring Transparency and \nExplainability \n \n \n \n \n \n*This core principle is based on the \"Core Principles and Policies for Artificial \nIntelligence (AI) Applications in the Financial Industry\" published by the FSC \non October 17, 2023. \nI. Purpose \nWhen financial institutions use AI to interact with consumers, their \ndecisions or interactions have significant effects on consumers. \nFinancial institutions are therefore advised to disclose relevant \ninformation to consumers in an appropriate manner. If a financial \ninstitution develops its own AI system or commissions a third party to \ndo so, it should ensure that their personnel can clearly explain the logic \nof the AI system's operation internally and to the auditors when \nnecessary, so that when it is necessary to modify or review the AI system, \nit can be done under appropriate conditions. \nII. Main Concepts \n(I) Transparency: Transparency refers to the provision of information about \nAI systems to external stakeholders to help them understand the impact \non their rights and interests as well as the limitations and risks of such \nAI systems. \n(II) Explainability: This refers to the possibility to clearly explain the \noperation of the AI system developed or commissioned by the \nfinancial institution for use, as well as the logic behind its prediction \nor decision-making process. It facilitates the financial institution's \nassessment of its compliance with internal policies, operational \nprocedures, and supervisory requirements. \n(III) A financial institution should learn about how the AI system it applies \nmakes decisions and should enhance the explainability of the AI \nsystem to ensure effective management of AI system operations. \n(IV) When applying an AI system, a financial institution should proactively \nCore Principle 5: Ensuring transparency and explainability \n(I) Financial institutions should ensure the transparency and \nexplainability of their operations. \n(II) Financial institutions should make proper disclosure when their AI \nsystem interacts directly with consumers. \n28 \n \ndisclose relevant information to stakeholders. If stakeholders request \nadditional explanation, they should provide appropriate explanation \nof the information used, how the information affects decision-making, \nand the impact of decisions on stakeholders to increase public trust. \nHowever, if the AI system applied by the financial institution is for \nmoney laundering prevention, information security, or fraud detection, \nor if it involves the trade secrets of the company, or if excessive \ndisclosure of information may lead to other risks, it is advisable to \ncarefully review the necessity and extent of disclosure of relevant \ninformation to individuals other than the competent authority. \n(V) Financial institutions are advised to set common principles for \ntransparency and explainability at each stage of the AI system life \ncycle: \n1. Transparency \n(1) A financial institution should establish common principles for \nassessing the required transparency of AI systems, such as the \nextent, timing, and form of explanation provided to customers when \nusing an AI system to generate loan decision recommendations. \n(2) A financial institution should identify items that they may need to \ninform customers of at different stages of the customer service life \ncycle, and prepare sample notifications in advance. \n2. Explainability \n(1) A financial institution should establish common principles for \nassessing the explainability of AI systems, including how to assess \nthe degree of explainability required and the intended recipients of \nrelevant information. \n(2) A financial institution should select a suitable method of explanation \nfor the AI system and specify the basic requirements of the \naforementioned method of explanation. \nIII. Implementation of Transparency and Explainability \nFinancial institutions are advised to pay attention to the following issues at \neach phase of the AI system life cycle: \n(I) \"System planning and design\" phase \n1. Transparency \n(1) A financial institution should determine the degree of transparency \nof its AI system in accordance with the principle of commonality \n29 \n \nof transparency, and identify the active and passive notification \nitems and their forms required for each stage of the customer life \ncycle. \n(2) When a financial institution plans to use an AI system to interact \nwith financial consumers, it should adopt a plan for appropriate \ndisclosure of relevant information in plain language. Examples \ninclude: \n\u02d9 Help financial consumers understand that the financial product \nor service they are considering is provided by AI. \n\u02d9 Help financial consumers understand the functions and expected \nperformance of the AI system in regular use, and inform \nfinancial consumers of the possible positive and negative \nimpacts. \n\u02d9 If a financial institution applies the AI system to assist in making \ndecisions, it is advisable to consider providing additional \ninformation to financial consumers so that they understand how \nthese decisions are made. \n2. Explainability \n(1) A financial institution should determine the required level of \nexplainability and the recipients of relevant information based on \nthe commonality principle of explainability assessed during \npreparation. \n(2) A financial institution should select an appropriate method of \nexplanation based on the degree of explainability mentioned \nabove, and evaluate whether the method of explanation meets the \nbasic requirements. \n(3) If a financial institution develops its own AI system or \ncommissions a third party to do so, it is advisable to plan for the \npreparation of relevant documents or technical reports on the \nstructure of the AI system, and plan for providing supervisory \nauthorities with access to and understanding of the AI system and \nthe data used. It will enable them find information and \nunderstand the operations of the financial institution's AI system \nand the appropriateness of the data used in the future. \n(II) \"Data collection and input\" phase: To meet future transparency or \nexplainability requirements, a financial institution should ensure that \ninformation related to the training of the AI system (e.g. data sources, \ntime points, consumer consent, data dictionaries, and known \n30 \n \nlimitations of the data) is retained written or digital form. \n(III) \"Modeling and validation\" phase \n1. Transparency \n(1) A financial institution is advised to test and validate the \ncorresponding functions in accordance with transparency \nrequirements. \n(2) A financial institution is advised to adopt a plan for appropriate \nadjustments of operating procedures (e.g. customer service and \ncomplaint handling procedures) to enhance transparency to \ncustomers and train employees to respond to customer inquiries. \n(3) A financial institution is advised to appropriately disclose and \nupdate the terms of service for customers or websites. It should, \nfor example, explain to customers how the AI system uses \ncustomer information, the benefits and risks to customers, and \nhow customers can participate, withdraw, and raise questions. \n2. Explainability \n(1) If a financial institution develops its own AI system or \ncommissions a third party to do so, it should submit an \nexplainability report in accordance with the explainability \nrequirements. \n(2) The financial institution shall review and confirm whether the \nexplanation is appropriate and ensure the level of explanation is \ncommensurate with the importance of the AI system application. \nIf the explainability of the AI system does not meet the financial \ninstitution's expectations, it is advisable to plan other measures \n(e.g. switching to simpler models, removing difficult-to-explain \nfunctions, or introducing more human supervision). \n(3) After building a model, the financial institution should verify that \nits employees understand the architecture, algorithms, functions, \nand decision-making factors of the AI system, and that the \noperating procedures of the AI system can be understood and \nexplained. If employees fail to clearly explain such information, it \nis advisable to review whether the financial institution should \navoid the use of architecture, algorithms, or functions that are too \ncomplex or unexplainable. \n(IV) \"System deployment and monitoring\" phase: \n  1. Before a financial institution uses AI to interact directly with a \n31 \n \nconsumer, it is advisable to proactively inform the consumer that the \ninteraction or service is provided with automated response from an \nAI system. \n2. A financial institution os advised to provide appropriate description \nand explanation based on customers' needs. For customers who may \nbe subject to adverse and unfair treatment in the system, a financial \ninstitution may assess the logic of the predictions, recommendations, \nor decision-making in the AI system in a simple and easy-to-\nunderstand manner. However, it must remain vigilant regarding risks \nof excessive information disclosure. \n  3. A financial institution should periodically monitor its AI system to \nensure the attainment of transparency and explainability. \n  4.To increase market trust in AI, a financial institution may, if necessary, \nproactively inform stakeholders of its AI practices through the \npublication of reports, technical documents, or the disclosure of \nrelevant information on its website, including describing the purpose \nof its AI system, its principle of operations, data and algorithms used, \nand the possible impacts of its AI system. \n \n \n32 \n \nChapter 6 Promoting Sustainable Development \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n*This core principle is based on the \"Core Principles and Policies for Artificial \nIntelligence (AI) Applications in the Financial Industry\" published by the FSC on \nOctober 17, 2023. \nI. Purpose \nThe operation of AI systems may consume energy and water, and may \ndeprive or threaten the work of current employees while exacerbating \nthe digital divide. Financial institutions should therefore enhance their \nsocial and environmental responsibilities, such as using emerging \ntechnologies to reduce the consumption of resources and facilitating \ninclusive finance in the digital transformation. Financial institutions \nshould also consider the transformation of their regular employees \nduring the digital transformation to pursue sustainable and stable \ndevelopment. \nII. Main Concepts \n(I) When financial institutions apply AI systems, they should consider the \nsociety and the environment as stakeholders and support social equity \nand ecological responsibility, such as promoting inclusive finance in the \ndigital transformation, reducing the digital gap, and minimizing the \nconsumption of water, electricity, and other energy in the process of \nusing AI. \n(II) The strategy for the application of AI systems by financial institutions \nand implementation strategies should be based on international \nsustainability goals as well as their own sustainability principles. They \nshould also include appropriate sustainability indicators. \nIII. Implementation of Sustainable Development \nCore Principle 6: Promoting sustainable development \n(I) Financial institutions should, when applying AI systems, ensure that \ntheir AI development strategies and implementation are \ncommensurate with the principle of sustainable development, \nincluding reducing economic and social inequality, and protecting \nnatural environment, thereby promoting inclusive growth, \nsustainable development and social wellness. \n(II) Financial institutions should, in the process of applying AI systems, \nprovide employees with proper education and training that could \nhelp them adapt to changes brought about by AI, and make efforts \nto protect employees' work rights. \n33 \n \n(I) Identify the impact: A financial institution should establish mechanisms \nto identify and assess the impact or risks of its AI system on the \nenvironment and society. \n(II) Optimize hardware facilities: A financial institution should choose \nhardware facilities with higher energy efficiency to reduce energy \nconsumption, such as using energy-efficient servers, low-power \nprocessors, and high-efficiency data center equipment. It should also \noptimize the configuration and management of hardware facilities to \nimprove energy efficiency. \n(III) Sharing resources and virtualization: A financial institution can use \nvirtualization technology and resource sharing to centralize the \nmanagement of computing resources and data storage.

A financial \ninstitution can also utilize right-of-use hardware equipment to reduce \nthe use of raw materials. \n(VIII) Reducing digital anxiety and the digital gap: Financial institutions \ncan provide services that meet the needs of financial consumers \nbased on their attributes to reduce any possible digital anxiety or \ndigital gap. For example, they can provide financial consumers with \nthe opportunity to opt for face-to-face services to reduce customer \nanxiety about AI systems, or provide a digital experience with \nincentives for disadvantaged groups to adopt digital services for \ndigital applications. \n34 \n \nIV. Employee Education and Training \n(I) Financial institutions must respect and protect the rights and interests of \nregular employees, including providing appropriate education and \ntraining to help them adapt to the new work environment and minimize \nthe risk of unemployment during the digital transformation. \n(II) When using AI systems, financial institutions should provide relevant \ntraining to their employees, including the basic concepts and operation \nof AI and how AI affects individual departments and work processes. \nThey should set up task forces as necessary to monitor the impact of \nthe AI system and the adaptation of their employees. They should also \nadjust the training programs based on actual requirements. \n(III) Financial institutions may also raise the awareness of their employees \nin terms of energy conservation, reducing the overuse of resources, \nand care for the digitally disadvantaged, and provide corresponding \ntraining and guidance to enhance their implementation of sustainable \ndevelopment. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n \nReferences \n1.Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency (OCC), 2011, \"Supervisory Guidance on \nModel Risk Management.\" \n2.Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, 2023, \"Capabilities \nand risks from frontier AI.\" \n3.European Commission (EU), 2019, \"Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy \nAI\", High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence. \n4.Financial Stability Institute (FSI), 2021, \"Humans Keeping AI in \ncheck\u2014emerging regulatory expectations in the financial sector\", FSI \nInsights on policy implications No. 35. \n5.International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), 2021, \n\"The Use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning by Market \nIntermediaries and Asset Managers.\" \n6.Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), 2022, \"Veritas Document 3: \nFEAT Principles Assessment Methodology.\" \n7.Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), 2022, \"Veritas Document 3A: \nFEAT Fairness Principles Assessment Methodology.\" \n8.Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), 2022, \"Veritas Document 3B - \nFEAT Ethics and Accountability Principles Assessment Methodology.\" \n9.Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), 2022, \"Veritas Document 3C - \nFEAT Transparency Principles Assessment Methodology.\" \n10.National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) et al., 2023, \"Guidelines for \nsecure AI system development.\" \n11.National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 2023, \"AI Risk \nManagement Framework (AI RMF 1.0).\" \n12.

Foreword \nThe increasing applications of AI1 in financial services have benefitted \nfinancial institutions in the provision of customer service. However new \nrisks, problems, and supervision challenges have also arisen. To help \nfinancial institutions make the most of AI technology while effectively \nmanaging risks, ensuring fairness, protecting consumer interests, \nmaintaining system security, and achieving sustainability, the Financial \nSupervisory Commission (FSC), based on the Executive Yuan's \"AI \nTaiwan Action Plan 2.0\" and promotion strategies determined in the \n\"Special Meeting for Coordination of Digital Policies and Legislation,\" and \nin reference to the relevant guiding principles issued by the financial \nsupervisory authorities of major countries and international organizations, \nand taking into consideration the development status of our financial \nmarket and the directions of FSC supervisory policy, has formulated six \ncore principles for AI applications tailored to our financial sector. These \nprinciples seek to steer financial institutions toward actively investing in \ntechnological innovation and bringing about financial service upgrade \nunder the premise that consumer interests, the order of the financial market, \nand social responsibility are also taken into account. \nBelow are descriptions of the impacts of AI and the positions and rules \nof international organizations or major countries on AI, the current status \nof AI application in Taiwan's financial sector, the necessity of formulating \nAI principles and policies, six core principles for AI applications in our \nfinancial sector, and the FSC's supporting policies for the development and \npromotion of AI. \n2.Impacts of AI and the positions and rules of international \norganizations or major countries on AI \n2.1 Advantages of AI technology and potential issues \n \n1 Given the continuous advancements in AI, international organizations and governments around the \nworld have not defined AI, but rather focus on \"AI systems.\" This paper will use the term \"AI\" and \"AI \nsystem\" alternately. According to the definition of The Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment (OECD), \"AI system\" is a machine-based system that can, for a given set of objectives, \ngenerate outputs (e.g. predictions, recommendations or decisions) to influence the environments. It uses \nmachine- or human- based data and inputs to (1) perceive real or virtual environment; (2) abstract such \nperceptions into models through automated analysis (e.g. use machine learning) or human analysis; and \n(3) use model inference to formulate options for information or action. Different AI systems are designed \nwith different levels of autonomy after deployment. \n \n \n \n2 \n \nThe development of AI technology is expected to bring enormous \neconomic and social benefits, which will be demonstrated in many \ndifferent areas, including the environment, health, the public sector, \nfinance, transportation, domestic affairs, and agriculture. As AI utilizes \nmassive data and computing power, it is particularly useful for improving \nprediction, optimizing operations and resource allocation, and customizing \nservices, thereby benefiting mankind tremendously. \nHowever, AI systems also raise new ethical issues that may influence the \nvalue and lives of mankind. Thus AI should be used with caution, for issues \narising from the use of AI may have implications regarding decision-\nmaking, labor and employment, social interactions, healthcare, education, \nmedia, access to information, the digital divide, personal data and \nconsumer protection, the environment, democracy, rule of law, security and \nlaw enforcement, and human rights and fundamental freedoms (including \nfreedom of expression, privacy, and non-discrimination). In addition, AI \nmay accentuate those ethical challenges. That is because AI algorithms can \nreplicate and amplify existing biases, thereby exacerbating existing forms \nof discrimination, prejudice, and stereotyping. Previously when certain \nproblems were handled by humans, it was easier to control situations. But \nan AI system is capable of executing tasks rapidly. In the absence of proper \ndesign and control, it could be perilous when AI performs certain tasks for \nhumans and unforeseen circumstances arise. \nMoreover, the rapid evolution of generative AI2 in recent years and its \nextensive impact on many fields are regarded as a major breakthrough for \nAI. The introduction of generative AI may help boost production efficiency \nand provide a wide variety of functions and services. But it may also \ninvolve personal data leaks, privacy issues, information security risks, and \nother legal risks. The capability of generative AI to create new content \nrapidly might create massive amounts of questionable or false information, \nthereby raising concern about the spread of false information. \nIn a long-term perspective, the use of AI systems, in particular \ngenerative AI that enables the creation of customized texts and images \nbased on personal preferences, could challenge humans' special sense of \nexperience and agency, thereby raising additional concerns about human \nself-understanding, social, cultural, and environmental interaction, \nautonomy, agency, worth, and dignity. \n \n \n2 According to Article 28b(4) of EU's Artificial Intelligence Act proposal, generative AI is defined as \n\"AI systems specifically intended to generate with varying levels of autonomy, content such as complex \ntext, images, audio or video.\" \n3 \n \n2.2 Positions of international organizations and major countries on AI \nIn light of the rapid development of AI in recent years, major \norganizations are paying increasing attention to AI. Those organizations \nalso call on members to include their recommendations in their policies, \nregulations, and measures. In the Recommendation on the Ethics of AI3 \nreleased by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization (UNESCO) in 2021, it identifies \"respecting, protecting and \npromoting human rights and fundamental freedoms, and human dignity\" \nas core values and recommends ten principles - \"proportionality and do not \nharm,\" \"safety and security,\" \"fairness and non-discrimination,\" \n\"sustainability,\" \"right to privacy and data protection,\" \"human oversight \nand determination,\" \"transparency and explainability,\" \"responsibility and \naccountability,\" \"awareness and literacy,\" and \"multi-stakeholder and \nadaptive governance and collaboration\" for reference in every policy area. \nThe \"AI Principles\"4 published by The Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) in 2019 promote the use of AI that is \n\"innovative and trustworthy and that respects human rights and democratic \nvalues,\" and recommend five values-based principles \u2013 \"inclusive growth, \nsustainable development and well-being,\" \"human-centric values and \nfairness,\" \"transparency and explainability,\" \"robustness, security and \nsafety,\" and \"accountability\" for adoption by policymakers. \nThe G7 Digital and Tech Ministers' Meeting 5  held in April 2023 \ndeclares an agreement on five principles for developing emerging \ntechnologies \u2013 \"rule of law,\" \"due process,\" \"democracy,\" \"respect for \nhuman rights,\" and \"utilizing opportunities for innovation.\" \nThe United States passed the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative \nAct of 20206 in 2020, and enacted it in 2021. The Act seeks to ensure \ncontinued US leadership in AI research and development, lead the world \nin the use of trustworthy AI systems in the public and private sectors, \nprepare the present and future US workforce for the integration of AI \nsystems, and coordinate ongoing AI activities among departments of the \nfederal government. The White House published the Blueprint for an AI \nBill of Rights 7 , which outlines five principles \u2013 \"safe and effective \nsystems,\" \"algorithmic discrimination protections,\" \"data privacy,\" \"notice \nand explanation,\" and \"human alternatives, consideration and fallback\" to \n \n3 Please refer to https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000380455 \n4 Please refer to https://oecd.ai/en/ai-principles \n5 Please refer to https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/G-7-ministers-agree-to-five-principles-\nfor-assessing-AI-risks \n6 Please refer to https://www.congress.gov/116/crpt/hrpt625/CRPT-116hrpt617.pdf#page=1210 \n7 Please refer to https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/ \n4 \n \nguide the design, use, and deployment of AI automated systems to protect \nthe American public. \nThe European Council passed the draft Artificial Intelligence Act8 in \nJune 2023 to ensure that Europe develops and uses AI in a manner \nconsistent with the rights and values of the EU. The Act classifies the risks \nof AI systems into four categories - \"unacceptable risk,\" \"high risk,\" \n\"limited risk,\" and \"minimal risk,\" and adopts corresponding measures of \n\"prohibited AI practices,\" \"regulatory control,\" \"transparency,\" and \"no \nlegal obligations\" based on the level of risk. For instance, AI practices that \nare considered to be a clear threat to humans\u2019 livelihoods and rights, such \nas social scoring, which present \"unacceptable risk,\" are banned. For AI \nsystems that might create adverse impact on humans\u2019 fundamental rights \nor safety, such as access to private essential services, which present \"high \nrisk,\" such a service provider must first undergo a conformity assessment \ntest and register with the EU before it is put on the market (existing service \nproviders are regulated by existing law), and must comply with a range of \nrequirements on risk management, testing, technical robustness, data \ntraining and data governance, transparency, human oversight, and \ncybersecurity. AI systems presenting limited risk, such as systems that \ninteract with humans (i.e. chatbots), emotion recognition systems, \nbiometric categorization systems, and AI systems that generate or \nmanipulate images and audio or video content (i.e. deepfakes) would be \nsubject to a set of transparency regulations. AI systems presenting minimal \nrisk, such as email filtering software, could be developed and used in the \nEU without conforming to any additional legal obligations. However, the \nEU will create codes of conduct for the reference of businesses. \nTaiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology 9  drafted the \"AI \nTechnology R&D Guidelines\" in September 2019. These Guidelines \nidentify the core values of \"human-centered values,\" \"sustainable \ndevelopment,\" and \"diversity and inclusion,\" and take into consideration \nthe academic freedom of AI researchers to encourage AI innovation, \nuphold human rights and universal values, and perfect the domestic AI \nR&D environment. The Guidelines set out eight principles, including \n\"Common Good and Well-being,\" \"Fairness and Non-discrimination,\" \n\"Autonomy and Control,\" \"Safety,\" \"Privacy and Data Governance,\" \n\"Transparency and Traceability,\" \"Explainability,\" and \"Accountability and \nCommunication.\" \nThe Executive Yuan approved and published the \"AI Taiwan Action Plan \n \n8 Please refer to \nhttps://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/698792/EPRS_BRI(2021)698792_EN.pdf \n9 Please refer to https://www.nstc.gov.tw/nstc/attachments/53491881-eb0d-443f-9169-1f434f7d33c7 \n5 \n \n2.0\" in April 2023, which declares the visions of \"Use AI to drive industrial \ntransformation and upgrading, use AI to help improve social well-being, \nand turn Taiwan a global vanguard of AI.\" The Action Plan 2.0 also lays \nout the tasks of starting with individual industries to bring about the \ntransformation and upgrade of all industries, building a trustworthy AI \nenvironment that puts equal emphasis on technological innovation and risk \ngovernance, being prepared for social impacts brought about by AI, \ndeveloping an inclusive digital economy with AI, and addressing major \nchallenges faced by society to enhance the well-being of all humans. \n2.3 Supervisory recommendations of international organizations and major \ncountries on AI applications in the financial sector \nAI has come into increasing use in financial services in recent years. \nWhile the implementation of AI has created benefits for the financial sector, \nincluding better service efficiency, lower cost of services, and an enhanced \ncustomer experience, it has also created new risks and supervisory \nchallenges regarding such possibilities as personal data leaks, privacy \nbreaches, ethical concerns, and workforce transformation. Thus, the \nquestion of how to make sure financial institutions can effectively manage \nrisks, ensure fairness, protect consumer interests, maintain system security, \nand achieve sustainable development while using AI is an issue that \nfinancial supervisory authorities and financial institutions must address. \nThe Financial Stability Board (FSB) published the \"Artificial \nintelligence and machine learning in financial services\u2014Market \ndevelopments and financial stability implications\"10 in 2017, which relates \nthat AI and machine learning (ML) can help financial institutions process \ninformation and data more efficiently, and the adoption of regulatory \ntechnology (RegTech) and supervisory technology (SupTech) can help \nimprove regulatory compliance and increase supervisory effectiveness. \nThe FSB also points out the following risks associated with AI and ML: \n(1)Network effects and scalability of new technologies may in the future \ngive rise to third-party dependencies. This could in turn lead to the \nemergence of new systemically important players that could fall \noutside the regulatory perimeter. \n(2)Applications of AI and ML could result in new and unexpected forms \nof interconnectedness between financial markets and institutions, \nbecause of the use by various institutions of previously unrelated data \nsources. \n(3)The lack of interpretability or auditability of AI and ML methods \n \n10 Please refer to https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P011117.pdf \n6 \n \ncould become a macro-level risk. Similarly, a widespread use of \nopaque models may result in unintended consequences. \nThe FSB advises that it is important to assess uses of AI and ML in view \nof their risks, including adherence to relevant protocols on data privacy, \nconduct risks, and cybersecurity. Adequate testing and training of tools \nwith unbiased data and feedback mechanisms is important to ensure that \napplications can function as expected. \nThe Financial Stability Institute (FSI) under the Bank for International \nSettlements (BIS) released \"Humans Keeping AI in check\u2014emerging \nregulatory expectations in the financial sector\" 11  in 2021. The paper \nclassifies AI systems used by financial institutions into two categories \u2013 \ncustomer-facing and non customer-facing. In the customer-facing category, \nAI systems are further divided into two types based on their impact on \ncustomers \u2013 low impact (e.g. chatbots) and high impact (e.g. credit scoring); \nin the non customer-facing category, AI systems are also further divided \ninto two types, depending on whether supervisory approval is required - \nsupervisory approval not required (e.g. internal operating processes) and \nsupervisory approval required (e.g. regulatory capital adequacy \nassessment). It is hoped that financial supervisory authorities will set forth \nsupervisory measures based on four principles \u2013 \"transparency,\" \n\"reliability and soundness,\" \"accountability,\" and \"fairness and ethics,\" and \nat the same time, address possible challenges through proportionality. \nThe International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) \nreleased \"The Use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning by \nMarket Intermediaries and Asset Managers\"12 in 2021, which proposes six \nmeasures that financial supervisory authorities can adopt, including \nrequiring financial institutions to: (1) have appropriate governance, \ncontrols and oversight frameworks; (2) monitor the development, testing, \nuse and performance monitoring of AI and ML on a continuous basis; (3) \nmake sure that staff have adequate knowledge, skills and experience to \nimplement, oversee, and challenge the outcomes of AI and ML; (4) \nunderstand their reliance on the third-party providers of AI and ML \nservices, and establish sound management and oversight mechanisms; (5) \nprovide proper transparency and disclose information to investors, \nregulators and stakeholders; and (6) have appropriate controls in place to \nensure that the data and the performance of the AI and ML can minimize \nbias. \n \n11 Please refer to https://www.bis.org/fsi/publ/insights35.pdf \n12 Please refer to https://www.iosco.org/library/pubdocs/pdf/IOSCOPD684.pdf \n7 \n \nThe financial supervisory authorities of the United States13, Singapore14, \nSouth Korea15, and many other countries have set out relevant guidelines \nand principles, which mostly emphasize \"fairness and ethics,\" \n\"transparency,\" \"accountability,\" \"consumer interests and privacy \nprotection,\" and \"security and robustness.\" \n3.Current status of AI adoption in Taiwan's financial sector, the \nnecessity of formulating AI principles and policies \n3.1 AI or generative AI applications in Taiwan's financial sector \nAccording to a survey of 175 financial institutions in Taiwan conducted \nby the FSC in May 2023, 63 of them (36%) have adopted AI technology \nfor use in (1) customer relationship management, such as smart customer \nservice and robo-advisor services; (2) risk management and compliance, \nincluding money laundering prevention, analysis of suspicious transactions, \nand account opening review; (3) process improvement, including optical \ncharacter recognition (OCR) and backend process automation; (4) data \nanalysis, such as customer attributes and consumption behavior analysis, \nmarket trend analysis, etc.; and (5) others, such as using threat intelligence \nto analyze security scenarios. \nIn addition, to understand the use of ChatGPT or other generative AI by \nTaiwan's financial institutions, the FSC completed a questionnaire survey \nin April 2023. The survey finds that currently no financial institutions use \ngenerative AI in financial services or internal operations. However two \ninstitutions are planning the implementation of AI, while 80 financial \ninstitutions and self-regulatory organizations are evaluating the \nintroduction of AI. \nAnother 95 financial institutions and self-regulatory organizations have \nimplemented control over the use of generative AI by employees, including \nthe setup of firewalls to block intranet connection to ChatGPT and putting \nin place internal rules to prevent the leakage of customer data. \nIn the future, the FSC will continue to communicate with financial \ninstitutions regarding the use of generative AI, and evaluate and adjust \nrelevant rules in view of industry's development status and applications to \nfacilitate compliance by financial institutions. \n3.2 FSC legislation for implementation of emerging technologies by \n \n13 Please refer to https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/inline-\nfiles/AI%20principles%20as%20Adopted%20by%20the%20TF_0807.pdf \n14 Please refer to https://www.mas.gov.sg/-\n/media/mas/resource/news_room/press_releases/2018/annex-a-summary-of-the-feat-principles.pdf \n15 Please refer to https://www.fsc.go.kr/eng/pr010101/76209 \n8 \n \nfinancial institutions \n3.2.1 Banking industry: \n(1)In response to the development of new technologies, the FSC has \napproved the amended Operating Rules for the Use of Emerging \nTechnologies by Financial Institutions in April 2020 to help banks \nmanage risks associated with new technologies and promote the \nsound operation of banking business, including the security \nmanagement of cloud services, social media management procedures, \nsecurity management of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), and \nsecurity management of biometric data. \n(2)With regard to the prevention of AI deepfakes, the FSC has instructed \nthe Bankers Association in its Standards for the Security \nManagement of Electronic Banking Business of Financial \nInstitutions to require that when a bank uses video conference in its \nelectronic banking business, it shall make sure it is the customer, a \nreal person, who appears in the video to prevent fake identity through \nthe use of pre-recorded film, masking, simulated imaging, or \ndeepfake, and retain an authentication record and transaction trail to \nfacilitate verification. The FSC has also instructed the Bankers \nAssociation to include AI use in self-regulatory rules for banks. \n3.2.2 Securities and futures industry: \n(1)Preventing the use of AI deepfake technology in the creation of fake \nidentities: The FSC in September 2022 approved amended \ninformation security self-regulatory rules for emerging technologies \ndrafted by the Securities Association and Futures Association that \nincludes the prevention of deepfakes. The amended rules require that \nwhen a securities/futures enterprise uses video imaging for identity \nverification, it shall also use a one-time password (OTP), a phone call, \nor an in-person visit and check the photograph on identity documents \nfor enhanced verification. Securities/futures enterprises are also \nadvised to carry out education and training on deepfake awareness \nand information security to shore up their risk management of \nemerging technologies. The existing rules will be reviewed in a \ntimely manner in view of AI development. \n(2)Enhancing the supervision of automated investment services to \nsafeguard the interests of investors: The current regulations require \nthat if an investment consulting firm offers automated investment \nservices, it should put in place effective supervision and management \nwith regard to whether the algorithmic design is logical and whether \n9 \n \nthe computing results are accurate, conduct preliminary evaluation \nand periodic review, and assign personnel to monitor the system \noperation to safeguard the interests of investors. The regulations also \nrequire investment consulting firms or their group enterprises to set \nup a committee in charge of supervising and managing the \ndevelopment and modification of algorithms, or participating in the \nreview and onsite investigation of external software developers so as \nto evaluate the adequacy of system design and ensure that the firm \nhas constructed comprehensive prevention, detection, and handling \nmeasures for network security. \n3.2.3 Insurance industry: \nIn response to the development of Fintech, the FSC has been promoting \nthe application of new technologies (e.g. AI, blockchain, biometrics) in \ninsurance products and services and has drafted related supervisory \nregulations, such as the Directions for Insurance Enterprises Engaging in \nElectronic Commerce Business, Directions for Insurance Companies \nProviding Distance Insurance Underwriting and Services, and compliance \nmatters and self-regulatory rules for all kinds of businesses, which require \ninsurance enterprises to implement information security (including \nobtaining ISO 27001 certification for their Information Security \nManagement System and Personal Information Management System), \nmoney laundering control, personal data protection, protection of customer \ninterests, and including those activities in their internal control systems to \nfacilitate compliance by insurance enterprises. \n3.3 The necessity for the FSC to draft AI principles and guidance \nFrom a tech-neutral standpoint, financial institutions still need to comply \nwith the prevailing financial regulations and market self-regulatory rules \nwhen using AI in their operations. However issues such as ethics, fairness, \nprivacy, and transparency may arise in the application of AI technology. To \nensure that associated risks are fully addressed in the prevailing regulations, \nit is necessary to draft a set of principles and policies in conformance with \nthe recommendations of international organizations so as to ensure the use \nof AI will bring only positive benefits to society, the economy, and \nconsumers. \nIn reference to the supervisory principles and guidelines of international \norganizations and major countries for AI and ML, and in consideration of \nAI practices in finance, possible issues arising therefrom, and the \ndevelopment status of our financial market, the FSC has drafted six core \nprinciples for use of AI in the financial sector. It is hoped that those six \nprinciples can guide financial institutions in the innovation and practice of \n10 \n \nAI applications while ensuring that AI can be beneficial to maintaining the \nstability of financial systems and safeguarding the interests of consumers. \nThe FSC will subsequently draft guidelines based on those six core \nprinciples for the reference of and compliance by financial institutions. In \nthe future, the FSC will carry out rolling evaluations and adjustments in \nview of technological developments and the use status of AI systems in our \nfinancial market to keep abreast of the times and meet practical \ndevelopment needs. \n4. Six core principles for AI applications in the financial sector \nIn reference to the guiding principles developed by international \norganizations or the supervisory authorities of major countries for the use \nof AI in financial services, and taking into account the supervisory \nprinciples of \"responsible innovation,\" \"enhancing compliance,\" \"treating \ncustomers \nfairly,\" \n\"financial \ninclusion,\" \n\"information \nsecurity,\" \n\"information disclosure,\" \"sustainable finance,\" and \"caring for \nemployees,\" the FSC proposes the following six core principles for use of \nAI in the financial sector: \n4.1 Core Principle 1: Establishing governance and accountability \nmechanisms (corresponding to the supervisory principle of \n\"responsible innovation\") \n(1)Financial \ninstitutions \nshould \nbear \ninternal \nand \nexternal \nresponsibilities corresponding to the AI systems they use. Internal \nresponsibilities include assigning a senior executive to be responsible \nfor related oversight and management, and establishing an internal \ngovernance \nframework; \nexternal \nresponsibilities \ninvolve \nresponsibilities to consumers and the society, including protecting \nconsumer privacy and data security. \n(2)Financial institutions should establish a comprehensive and effective \nAI risk management mechanism, integrate it into prevailing risk \nmanagement and internal control operations or processes, and \nconduct periodic evaluation and testing. \n(3)Financial institutions should ensure that their employees have \nadequate knowledge and skills to work with AI, and carry out risk-\nbased decision making and supervision. \nDescription: \nThe FSC has adopted the strategy of promoting \"responsible innovation\" \nto encourage the use of technology to develop innovative financial \nproducts or services. On the other hand, the FSC emphasizes the \n11 \n \nimportance of financial market order and consumer protection to make sure \nfinancial innovation poses controllable risks and will have a positive effect \non financial market stability. Against this backdrop, the FSC has proposed \nthe principle of \"establishing governance and accountability mechanisms,\" \nstressing that financial institutions should be responsible for internal \ngovernance and consumer protection when applying AI systems, and \nshould oversee the risk management and use of AI systems. This is to \nensure that while pursuing innovation, financial institutions should also \nfulfill their commitment to social responsibility and strive to build a stable \nand fair financial market environment. \nThe principle of \"establishing governance and accountability \nmechanisms\" is of utmost importance to the use of AI systems by financial \ninstitutions. The spirit of this principle lies in the conviction that financial \ninstitutions should be responsible, both internally and externally, for the \nuse of AI systems. As such, financial institutions must establish a sound \ninternal governance framework in documented form, assign a senior officer \nto take charge of related supervision and management, explicitly define the \nduties of respective lines of business, and ensure the retention of records. \nThese measures help ensure the normal operation of AI systems and \ndiscover and resolve potential problems in a timely manner. \nThe responsibilities of financial institutions with regard to the use of AI \nsystems also cover consumers and social responsibilities. That is, the use \nof AI systems must fully respect and protect the privacy of consumers and \ninformation security. This is not only basic protection of consumer interests, \nbut also paramount to maintaining the business reputation and stable \noperations of the financial institution. \nFinancial institutions must establish an effective AI-related risk \nmanagement mechanism using a risk-based approach, and integrate it into \ntheir overall risk management and internal control operations and \nprocesses. In addition, after its AI system goes online, a financial institution \nshould conduct regular evaluation and testing, including documenting and \nmonitoring situations unforeseen at the time of system development, and if \nnecessary, should modify the system to make sure the AI system is secure \nand effective. \nLastly, this principle also emphasizes the importance of cultivating and \nenhancing employees' AI knowledge and risk identification and \nmanagement skills, and taking a risk-based approach to decision making \nand supervision. As AI technology advances, the knowledge and skills of \nemployees (including those engaged in development, testing, supervision, \ncompliance, risk management, and internal auditing) will have a direct \nbearing on whether the financial institution is able to make proper \n12 \n \ndecisions and effectively supervise the operations of AI systems. Thus \nfinancial institutions should conduct education and training on an ongoing \nbasis to make sure employees are capable of adapting to the rapid growth \nand evolution of AI technology and appropriately addressing related risks \nand challenges. \n4.2 Core Principle 2: Emphasizing fairness and human-centered \nvalues (corresponding to the supervisory principle of \"treating \ncustomers fairly and improving financial inclusion\") \n(1)Financial institutions should, in the process of utilizing AI systems, \ntry their best to avoid unfairness resulting from algorithmic bias. \n(2)The application of AI systems should be human-centric and \ncontrollable by humans, and should respect the rule of law and \ndemocratic values. \n(3)Risks associated with information produced by generative AI must be \nobjectively and professionally controlled by financial institution \npersonnel16. \nDescription: \nThe principle of \"emphasizing fairness and human-centered values\" is \nvital during the process of AI system implementation. Financial institutions \nthat introduce AI systems should recognize fully and try their best to avoid \npotential algorithmic bias. Especially when providing customer-facing AI \nservices, financial institutions must ensure the appropriateness of data \nsources and the quality of data, and conduct testing and validate the \nalgorithm in an independent environment prior to formal launch to avoid \nunintended consequences. Financial institutions should also strive to \nprovide all customers with fair and non-discriminatory financial services \nto achieve financial inclusion. In addition, the data, database, and models \nof an AI system should be subject to regular review and accuracy \nverification to reduce bias. \nIn addition, human-centered and human-controllable values and \napplications are facets that must be taken into consideration when financial \ninstitutions use AI systems. Aside from respecting consumer privacy \nduring the use of AI systems, financial institutions must make sure \nuniversal values such as the rule of law and democracy are also respected, \nand must put into place mechanisms to ensure that AI system evolve in \nsuch a way as to maintain the initial intent of system creation, that is, to \nassist humans without causing harm to humans while ensuring human \n \n16 In reference to Point 2 of the draft of \"Reference Guidelines for the Use of Generative AI by \nExecutive Yuan and Subordinate Agencies (Institutions).\" \n13 \n \nautonomy and control. Risks associated with information created by \ngenerative AI must be subject to the objective and professional control of \nfinancial institution personnel. \nBy stressing the principle of \"emphasizing fairness and human-centered \nvalues,\" the FSC urges financial institutions to pay attention to the values \nof diversity and inclusion when first designing AI systems, provide fair and \ninclusive financial services during the use of AI systems, and conform to \nsocial values and public expectations consistently throughout the entire \nprocess. \n4.3 Core Principle 3: Protecting privacy and customer interests \n(corresponding to the supervisory principle of \"protecting financial \nconsumers\") \n(1)Financial institutions should fully respect and protect the interests of \nconsumers, and manage and use customer data properly. \n(2)Financial institutions applying AI systems to provide financial \nservices should respect the customer's right to choose, and should \nremind the customer of available alternatives. \nDescription: \n\"Protecting privacy and customer interests\" is another important element \nfinancial institutions must consider when applying AI systems. With the \ndevelopment of big data and AI technology, the personal data of customers \nare often massively collected and used for the training of AI to increase its \naccuracy. But this practice may impact the privacy of customers, negatively \naffect public trust toward financial institutions, and lessen the degree of \nservice satisfaction. \nWhen using customer data, financial institutions must fully respect and \nprotect customer privacy and properly manage and utilize related data to \navoid any risk of data leakage. For example, in the absence of a proper \ncontrol mechanism (an example of a proper control mechanism is a \ngenerative AI model deployed in a closed, on-premises environment in a \nway that ensures the security of the system environment), a financial \ninstitution should not input data without customer consent for disclosure \ninto generative AI. Financial institutions should also respect the right of \ncustomers to choose AI services or not, and remind customers whether \nthere are alternatives available. This is a way to protect customers' right to \nchoose, and is also a way to safeguard customer interests. \nBy implementing the principle of \"protecting privacy and customer \ninterests,\" financial institutions are able to meet regulatory requirements, \n14 \n \nenhance consumer confidence and satisfaction, and promote sound \nbusiness development. \n4.4 Core Principle 4: Ensuring system robustness and security \n(corresponding to the supervisory principle of \"enhancing \ninformation security\") \n(1)When applying AI systems, financial institutions must ensure system \nrobustness, security, and safety to avoid causing harm to consumers \nor the financial system. \n(2)Financial institutions that outsource the development or operation of \nAI systems for financial services should conduct appropriate risk \nmanagement and oversight of the third-party providers. \nDescription: \nDigital technology is evolving rapidly, and AI has become an important \ntool for the financial industry to promote innovation and improve service \nquality. However, risks associated with the spread and use of AI are real. \nIn particular, due to the special nature of the financial services sector, any \nsystem error or data leak could cause immense harm to consumers or even \nthe entire financial system. Those risks could arise from technological \nmalfunctions, malicious attacks, or wrong decisions made by an AI system. \nTherefore, it is of utmost importance for financial institutions to \"ensure \nsystem robustness, security, and safety\" in the process of applying AI \nsystems. A financial institution must have adequate ability to develop and \nmaintain secure AI systems, and the ability to conduct ongoing monitoring \nof the operational results of AI systems, and take appropriate control \nmeasures where necessary. \nTo successfully \"ensure system robustness, security and safety,\" risk \nmanagement and oversight are indispensable when a financial institution \nprovides financial services applying AI systems developed or operated by \nthird-party service providers. Prior to engaging the service of such a third-\nparty service provider, a financial institution must perform due diligence \nto determine whether the service provider possesses related knowledge, \nexpertise, and experience, and must fully understand and evaluate the \noperating modes of its AI system and potential risks (including the \nhandling of data privacy, operating risks, information security, and \nconcentration risk), and based on the evaluation results, must implement a \nproper oversight strategy and management practices to prevent possible \nrisks or problems. The financial institution should also clearly define the \nresponsibilities of the service provider and plan ahead-of-time solutions for \nproblems that may arise in case of adverse events. In addition, financial \n15 \n \ninstitutions should have AI related algorithmic rules and save the trails and \nrecords to facilitate subsequent verification and management. \nBased on the principle of \"ensuring system robustness, security and \nsafety,\" the FSC hopes that while maintaining financial stability and \nprotecting consumer interests, financial institutions are able to use AI \nsystems in an innovative manner, with confidence and robustness, so as to \nprovide consumers with better financial services. \n4.5 Core Principle 5: Ensuring transparency and explainability \n(corresponding to the supervisory principle of \"information \ndisclosure\") \n(1)Financial institutions should ensure the transparency and \nexplainability of their operations. \n(2)Financial institutions should make proper disclosure when their AI \nsystem interacts directly with consumers\n17. \nDescription: \nIn the field of artificial intelligence, the importance of \"ensuring \ntransparency and explainability\" is widely acknowledged. It denotes that \nhow an AI system works should be comprehensible and explainable. This \nprinciple is all the more imperative when applying AI in financial services. \nFor financial institutions, explainable AI systems enable them to \neffectively assess and manage the risks of implementing AI and determine \nthe effectiveness of AI systems. Financial institutions must understand how \nAI makes decisions so as to detect potential problems and make necessary \nadjustments to ensure effective management of AI operations. \nFor stakeholders, the principle of \"ensuring transparency and \nexplainability\" implies that financial institutions should evaluate how to \nmake proper disclosure to stakeholders. For instance, a financial institution \nshould make proper disclosure when using AI to interact directly with \nconsumers; as for AI systems relating to money laundering prevention, \ninformation security, or fraud prevention, or involving trade secrets, risk \nmay arise from over-disclosure of information. In such event, a financial \ninstitution should be cautious about the contents of disclosure or opt not to \ndisclose. Financial institutions should also make sure the degree of \nexplainability matches the importance of an AI system. In particular, \nhumans who are adversely affected by an AI system should be able to \nunderstand or challenge the results of the AI system based on plain and \n \n17 In reference to Point 6 of the draft of \"Reference Guidelines for the Use of Generative AI by \nExecutive Yuan and Subordinate Agencies (Institutions).\" \n16 \n \neasy-to-understand information on the factors, and the logic that serves as \nthe basis for predictions, recommendations, or decisions. \n4.6 Core Principle 6: Promoting sustainable development \n(corresponding to the supervisory principle of \" Sustainable \nfinance and employee care\") \n(1)Financial institutions should, when applying AI systems, ensure that \ntheir \nAI \ndevelopment \nstrategies \nand \nimplementation \nare \ncommensurate with the principle of sustainable development, \nincluding reducing economic and social inequality, and protecting the \nnatural environment, thereby promoting inclusive growth, sustainable \ndevelopment, and social well-being. \n(2)Financial institutions should, in the process of applying AI systems, \nprovide employees with proper education and training that could help \nthem adapt to changes brought about by AI, and make efforts to \nprotect employees' work rights. \nDescription: \nThe purpose of formulating the principle of \"promoting sustainable \ndevelopment\" is to remind financial institutions that AI is used not only to \nimprove efficiency and profitability, but also to promote the inclusive \ngrowth and sustainable development of the entire society. \nFinancial institutions should ensure that their AI strategy and \nimplementation methodology match the principle of sustainable \ndevelopment. This means that, while offering innovative financial services, \na financial institution should also take into consideration how to increase \nthe financial participation of disadvantaged groups, how to reduce \neconomic, social, gender, and age inequalities, and how to promote \nenvironmental protection through financial technology. In the aspect of \nsustainable development, financial institutions should be aware that \nmassive amounts of energy used by AI systems could produce a negative \nimpact on the environment and ecosystems. \nIn addition, financial institutions must respect and protect the work \nrights of regular employees, including by providing proper education and \ntraining to employees during the course of AI transformation to help them \nadapt to the new working environment. This helps safeguard employees' \nwork rights and cultivates professionals with the skills to operate an AI \nsystem that will enhance the institution's competitive edge. \nOverall, this principle emphasizes that while using AI to pursue \neconomic benefits, a financial institution should give equal emphasis to the \n17 \n \nideals of sustainability, caring for the disadvantaged, reducing inequality, \nand protecting worker rights to promote the well-being and progress of the \nsociety as a whole. \n5. FSC's supporting policies for promoting AI development \n(1)On the basis of the aforementioned principles, the FSC will publish \nthe \"Guidelines for AI Applications in the Financial Industry\". Taking \ninto account factors such as the extent to which financial institutions \nuse AI systems, institutions' reliance on data, AI functions, \nautonomous behaviors, and whether AI systems are customer-facing \nor non-customer-facing, the guidelines will set out matters to comply \nwith based on the principle of proportionality, using a risk-based \napproach. The guidelines will seek to bring about the sound \ndevelopment of the financial sector , maintain financial stability, and \nsafeguard consumer interests. \n(2)Continue to examine relevant FSC regulation and make regulatory \nadjustments in a timely manner to build a sound regulatory \nenvironment for the use of AI systems in the financial sector. \n(3)Use AI technology to develop SupTech to enhance the efficiency and \neffectiveness of financial supervision. \n(4)Engage in exchanges and collaborations with international \norganizations and foreign financial supervisory agencies to ensure \nthat our supervisory policies are consistent with mainstream \ninternational trends. \n(5)Continue to encourage financial institutions to actively participate in \nAI research, development and application to provide customers with \nbetter financial services or develop RegTech. The FSC will also hold \nseminars and workshops to assist financial institutions in \nimplementing best practices. \n(6)Continue to grasp and inspect the actual status of AI use in the \nfinancial sector, and where necessary, conduct special financial \nexaminations to make sure financial institutions comply with \napplicable regulations and practice risk management in the use of AI \nsystems, and use AI to increase public trust and social well-being. \n(7)Instruct financial industry associations to draft self-regulatory \nstandards and best practices regarding the use of AI systems by \nfinancial institutions to enhance their information security, internal \ncontrol, and fair customer treatment, and make sure financial \ninstitutions continue to assist their employees in AI transformation \n18 \n \nand pay attention to worker rights in the course of AI implementation. \n(8)Continue to oversee financial institutions' compliance with fair \ncustomer treatment and friendly financial guidelines, and conduct \nfinancial literacy programs to enhance public awareness of the use of \ndigital financial tools, thereby reducing the digital divide and \nensuring the fair transformation of digital finance. \n6. Conclusion \nAs AI advances rapidly and its applications continue to expand, \ntrustworthy AI will play an increasingly important role in the field of \nfinance. AI offers wide-ranging potential, in matters ranging from \nimproving the efficiency of financial services to deepening customer \nrelations. However, to make the most of this new technology, one must \nseek a balance between innovation and responsibility in the use of AI \nsystems. One must ensure fairness and transparency, and be fully prepared \nfor possible risks and challenges. \nThe introduction of principles and policies for the use of AI in the \nfinancial sector aims to guide financial institutions to create value when \napplying AI systems, and moreover, to protect consumer interests, maintain \nfinancial stability, and realize inclusive sustainability. The FSC hopes that \nthrough the implementation of related principles and policies, financial \ninstitutions can maximize their functions and bring greater benefits to \ncustomers and society in the upcoming era of AI. \n \n19 \n \nAttachment: Six Core Principles for AI applications in the Financial \nSector \n1.Establishing governance and accountability mechanisms \n(1)Financial \ninstitutions \nshould \nbear \ninternal \nand \nexternal \nresponsibilities corresponding to the AI systems they use. Internal \nresponsibilities include assigning a senior executive to be responsible \nfor related oversight and management, and establishing an internal \ngovernance \nframework; \nexternal \nresponsibilities \ninvolve \nresponsibilities to consumers and the society, including protecting \nconsumer privacy and data security. \n(2)Financial institutions should establish a comprehensive and effective \nAI risk management mechanism, integrate it into prevailing risk \nmanagement and internal control operations or processes, and \nconduct periodic evaluation and testing. \n(3)Financial institutions should ensure that their employees have \nadequate knowledge and skills to work with AI, and carry out risk-\nbased decision making and supervision. \n2.Emphasizing fairness and human-centered values \n(1)Financial institutions should, in the process of utilizing AI systems, \ntry their best to avoid unfairness resulting from algorithmic bias. \n(2)The application of AI systems should be human-centric and \ncontrollable by humans, and should respect the rule of law and \ndemocratic values. \n(3)Risks associated with information produced by generative AI must be \nobjectively and professionally controlled by financial institution \npersonnel. \n3.Protecting privacy and customer interests \n(1)Financial institutions should fully respect and protect the interests of \nconsumers, and manage and use customer data properly. \n(2)Financial institutions applying AI systems to provide financial \nservices should respect the customer's right to choose, and should \nremind the customer of available alternatives. \n4.Ensuring system robustness and security \n(1)When applying AI systems, financial institutions must ensure system \nrobustness, security, and safety to avoid causing harm to consumers \nor the financial system. \n20 \n \n(2)Financial institutions that outsource the development or operation of \nAI systems for financial services should conduct appropriate risk \nmanagement and oversight of the third-party providers. \n5.Ensuring transparency and explainability \n(1)Financial institutions should ensure the transparency and \nexplainability of their operations. \n(2)Financial institutions should make proper disclosure when their AI \nsystem interacts directly with consumers. \n6.Promoting sustainable development \n(1)Financial institutions should, when applying AI systems, ensure that \ntheir \nAI \ndevelopment \nstrategies \nand \nimplementation \nare \ncommensurate with the principle of sustainable development, \nincluding reducing economic and social inequality, and protecting \nnatural environment, thereby promoting inclusive growth, sustainable \ndevelopment and social well-being. \n(2)Financial institutions should, in the process of applying AI systems, \nprovide employees with proper education and training that could help \nthem adapt to changes brought about by AI, and make efforts to \nprotect employees' work rights. \n \n", "metadata": {"country": "Taiwan", "year": "2024", "legally_binding": "no", "binding_proof": "This is a non-binding set of operational and supervisory guidelines issued by Taiwan\u2019s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) to direct the ethical and responsible use of AI in the financial sector.", "date": "06/20/2024", "regulator": "Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), Taiwan", "type": "sectoral AI policy", "status": "pending", "language": "English", "use_cases": "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"}}
